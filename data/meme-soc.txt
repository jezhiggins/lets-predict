I think he might have had work done up top :0
All that league stuff was quite long and I got a bit bored in the play-off stuff
Although I like that everything will work the same way
Not sure about the 75% rule
Might mean some teams force rotation to keep players available for twos, or might get stuff with players they want to drop but can't
Yeah it's kinda a necessary evil
Seems all okay to me
Other then you have to be 15 to play
That's bullshit
15 to play in the premier League
Not really

Good job hanging the fucking washing lads


MRHA leagues for the new season are out, and in a shock move KH1s seemed to have been promoted :o
Probably by other clubs dropping out.
They're in SW Prem, which means they're only one league below Bournville 2s.
Harborne 2s are in Mids 2, with Burton 1, Chesterfield 1, Cov & NW 1, Khalsa 2, Leek 2, Loughborough Town 2, Olton 2, Rugby 2, Stone 1, Streetly 1, Telford 1
Some big days out for you Hal
(Ah, I was wrong KH1 was in SWP last year)
Just looking at the disciplinary. Greg Wade got red carded again!
I second this, in terms of big decisions we are going to be discussing a potential merger with Edgbaston so if anyone has any thoughts feelings comments please come along or alternatively message foley or myself so we can raise your points
Just got this from the second 11 chat
The whole club?
I assume so
Hmm
Good Lads

Imagine trying to do that in the MHRA
MRHA
"From opening the batting - albeit as nightwatchman - and being named man of the match at Lord's, Leach paid a tenner in match fees, batted number six and bowled third change for Taunton Deane. He made 56 and took 1-8 in a 52-run win."

It's breaking out all over, Hampton might be dropping their Mens 6.
Got that from a remarkably up-front email from Warrick cancelling our 2s friendly.
We need another good olympic run. Better hope them men don't slip up against Malaysia
Hopefully November in England won't be ideal conditions for Faizal Saari and we'll squeak through on a pRoper rebound and Jacko PC.
That's not good news
About Hampton? No.
Yeah
I wonder if there are any clubs actually growing?
Yardley/ CoB
Anyone else
Women's hockey doesn't seem to be affected anywhere near as much as mens
It might be
But we just don't know about it
Several clubs locally run more womens than mens sides
EH have also done a decent job promoting womens hockey. They've got quite a good link up with netball and cricket.
Plus the women have a sponsor
Mens hockey hasn't really had that, and its always going to be down the list behind football, rugby, and cricket.
Yeah true
Huh - Isca and UoExeter have a combined team in Div One South.
Interesting
Exe Hockey is a womens club in Exeter.
They have a link with East Devon Hockey Club for mens
There's a lot of hockey down there, given it's not a massive place
Yeah that's true
It's weird the clubs down there have Mens 1s, then Mens A, Mens B, etc
Yeah trust
It is odd

Rule changes - playing in quarters for leagues with umpires with good stopwatches.
A free hit awarded to the defence within the defensive circle can be taken anywhere in
n up to 15 metres from the back-line in line with the location of the offence, parallel to the side-line.  (I was right after all Hal)
Additional wording in the guidance concerning the re-start after awarding a Free Hit to the attacking team within 5 metres of the circle they are attacking. The introduction of a quick self-pass for these Free Hits allows the defenders to stay within the circle, within 5m and not interfere with play until the ball can legitimately enter the circle. If there is no quick self-pass, then ALL defenders, regardless of location in the 23m, have to retreat 5m if they wish to legitimately play the ball once the Free Hit is taken.
If an attacker enters the circle at a Penalty Corner before permitted, the player taking the push or hit from the backline is required to go beyond the centre-line and the Penalty Corner is taken again.

Just watching Monday Night Hockey. The Exeter thrashing at Wimbledon was really grim, even more so because it had no commentary. Wimbledon scored so many the crowd couldn't even be bothered to clap.

When I read the EH League previews email, I hear it in the voice of Simon Mason.
"Doncaster have been deducted the three points gained in their 2-0 defeat of Lichfield on 29 September in the Men’s Conference North. This is due to the participation in the game of Henry Pymm, who, at the time, was not registered in line with league regulations. This made him ineligible to participate in the league. Henry is now registered."

"I have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is the probability I have two boys?"
I'm insulted
Why
That you think I'm going to fall for this 😉
No tricks
Just a maths puzzle
Ok. Here goes then
1/2
✖️
Wong
When you get home can you look and see if my big machine is still running
Wrong
I'm pretty sure it was? But I'll check
If its up, can you check thunderbird
It's either died or got stuck or something
Stuck probs
Order isn't important, so it's not 1/3
Think smarter
Okay I'll have a look when I get back
Also true
Is the second child not born on a Tuesday?
We don't know
The second child could be born on a Tuesday or could not
So we're looking for another boy, but not born on a Tuesday
No we're just looking for another boy
Hmm
Want the answer?
You have one boy in the probability of 1/2 and the probability of another is also 1/2
1/2 * 1/2 : 1/4
No
Oof
That's wrong anyway
Because he already has one boy
Yes and the question is what is the probability of two boys
And that's the probability of two boys
But he already has one, so the probably of him having one is 1 not 1/2
1/1 * 1/2 : 1/2
Which is also wrong
That as a calculation is not wrong tho?
It's not the right answer
Is it some answer close to a half but not quite because you do something with the probabilities of a combination of kids (not including two girls) where one is always tueaday and the other varies
So it moves from 1/3 not including the days to something else when you do include the days
It's close to a half
Work it out!
No, thats effort
But I was right in my thinking then
13/27
I'm not quite sure we can explain why
But I visualised a thing
Correct dad
If you hadn't specified the day it would be a half, right
But because the day was specified, the maths changes.
Yes

"They're currently preparing a new enclosure for some lemurs which arrive later in the year.  No lemurs equals no fun, you might think.  But not so!  A digger and men wearing hard hats in a cage are just as, if not more, interesting than any animal.  We also enjoyed the ten minutes entertainment provided by the guy washing out the water trough in the wallaby pen."

Slack as a company in the first place is weird. Stewart Butterworth was flickr co-founder, and flickr came out of a failed game launch. After flickr, he started another game company which also failed, but Slack came out of a tool they built at that company.
His career is like a series of really lucky accidents

You know that's what he wants to do really :)

Pick an expansion
The third one is zman not rio grande
I don't think it matters.
The tiles all come from Hans Im Gluck and although the artwork was changed a few years ago, the tiles backs are the same.
Okay
Oh right they're all zman
But the tile fronts will look funky right?
Yep
I looked on ebay for Rio Grande expansion and they are approximately one million pounds each

:/
You don't fancy any of them then?
Not sure!
I'm easy
It'll still be fun tbf even if the graphics are rifferent
But I can't decide which
I've seen traders and builders referred to as "the essential expansion"
Go for that one them

If they laid a second pitch at Hampton they lose the cricket pitch, and I can't see that happening. Haven't got the car parking to support it either.
Tru
If anyone had the space and the cash surely it would be sils?
Well, I just remembered hearing something about them doing it jointly
Sils has a bigger club house, more parking, more space. Plus they sold off that bit by the entrance for housing, so must have some of that in the bank.

Looks like I might have to look for a new club 😢
What? Why?
KH already owe Woodrush money for last season and we probably won't be able to run the fireworks this year ...
Shit
I don't know details yet, but we're in "can we keep the club afloat territory"
Damn
Is that just the seniors? Or does that include the juniors too?
The juniors funds are separate, but I don't know if they'd have to start paying pitch fees if the seniors folded.
When we moved to Woodrush, the deal was the juniors got Sunday pitches free if we gave free membership to Woodrush pupils and because of the Saturday bookings.
I don't know if that would continue,
I doubt it
And also, where would they go as they got older?
It's not like they do anywhere anyway
Most of them just leave
I think that's the case for a lot of junior sections, and junior sport in general.
Still not great though.

Sorry about this and please be assured the club and the 1st team management are doing everything they can to ensure we are back to level 4 on Thursday. Please update me if your availability has changed for tonight. Wadey

ame played in the Conference North but it proved to be a cracker with Barford Tigers coming back from 4-0 down to beat Belper 5-4.

a goal up in the first minute of the game and goals from Matthew Dear, Jake Read and Edward Stanhope made it 4-0 after just 22 minutes.

ed the fightback for Tigers just before half time and after the restart, Mark Ganly pulled another back immediately.

 brace to level the scores and with three minutes left on the clock, William Hewer found the winner.

Yup
https://hockeywrldnws.com/england-hockey-embarrassment-as-diversity-group-member-suspended/
In one of several allegations against Dr Gill, EH found that he openly criticised his umpire colleague from Yardley during a game last season where he used “highly derogatory terms in Punjabi meaning ‘dog’ or ‘idiot’”.
In the summer, England Hockey received an open letter accusing it of “bias” against BAME players. Published one month before the dispute hearing, the timing of the letter has been described as a “clever marketing tool” by one source familiar with Barford.

https://midlands.hockey/2021/01/29/statement-from-the-midland-mens-hockey-league-on-the-conclusion-of-the-2020-21-season/
"England Hockey is planning to increase the number of teams in the EHL in 2021/22. The Committee will decide at a later date a process to identify two teams from Tier 1 Midlands Premier as the new entries to the EHL from the Midlands. Our guiding principle will be, if at all possible, to identify those two teams from T1 MP via the field of play."
You'd guess Barton and West Bridgford, based on what was played this season and the season before, but whatever they decide is going to cause a stink.

The implications of this are that the 2020-21 will be declared null and void and there will be no promotions or relegations within the England Hockey Leagues this year. With the changes in the adult hockey structure nationally an extra England Hockey League Conference Division will be formed. The Regional Leagues are currently considering and communicating their approaches to finding the candidates for joining the division in line with guidance we have shared.

India Women beat Australia in the QF.
Indians going absolutely bananas. Australians all crying.

Netherlands just about to start against NZ. Not expecting an upset in this game.
In a reversal of the men's fixture, ARG women beat Germany earlier.
As expected right?
I'd say so. GBR vs ESP after this, which I think GBR should win. Not sure who plays who in the semis, but I reckon Netherlands to win the women's gold, other places up for grabs.
In the men, semis are India-Belgium, Australia-Germany so probably BEL-AUS final which I think Belgium will win.

Oof
What were results in mids prem
Knole Park are a new club - only a couple of years old - but it looks like they're some kind of Repton situation but for girls hockey, so their women's teams are stuffed with PC level kids, who just destroy the old'n'bold of lower league hockey.
They've got a men's team, but I looked at their result and I'm guessing it's Dads :)

There's also a Pembrokeshire team
They play at hwllfford
IN this league structure, Cardiff & Met 2 and Bath Buccs 2 are in Premier, then it's Div 1 Norht and South, four lots of Div 2, then 8 regions each with two divisions.
Fishguard are in the lowest div :)
You'll be right at home!
Prembroke Shire are in De Cymru Div 1
You'll have to travel much further than you do at the moment!
They have 2 away fictures in Swansea, and 4 in Cardiff :o
Och
Sorry 5 in Cardiff
Lots of lifts from the club!
Photo of F&G in minibus!
Pretty much all the away trips are fucking hours.
90 minutes to Neath, Aber Uni, Swansea
2 hours to Bridgend
Is it that far to neath?
Oh I suppose it's not far from Swansea
2 hours+ to Whitchurch
Good job it's on a 9 team league :)
12 if you get promoted!
Look at those results - solid mid-table

It's unusable at the moment

Only 10 goals a game? Pathetic.
What league is that?
Also how have repton and Nottingham not played eachother
Cuz rep have only won
But Nottingham have drawn
Oh they all still have a game to play other then 2 teams
Repton women's.
Women's Div 1
Men are Mids Div 2. Not quite so good, but still spanking everyone


150 for Jesus Christ
Put 21 past Old Hales, 22 past Worcester, 23 past Olton. Bromsgrove concede 10, Stourport just 7, so decent results there.
Good old nonces eh

Did you find a public server Hal?
It uses the Lego Universe data files @447757499873
You can run your own dark flame server, but you need the original LU data files
Yup
I believe so
So we could make our own server
For just us
Yes, we could
You download the original game of a sketchy website and the darkflame server stuff of GitHub
Then do some code magic
It was all a bit complicated for me so I just joined a random server I found
I'll have a look at the code magic part 🙂

Men's World Cup in Bhubaneswar kicks off in a couple of days
Eng vs Wales on first day 😮
Might even drop the money for it.
Easy pool for NED - Netherlands, Malaysia, Chile, New Zealand.
Tough pool for England - England, India, Spain, Wales
France could be the joker in Pool A - Argentina, Australia, France, South Africa
Pool B looks pretty straightforward - Belgium, Germany, Japan, Korea
No Pakistan!
India haven't won it since 1975, Nederlands haven't since 1998
As expected, some magnificent sports taches on display by the Australians
AUS 8 - 0 France
Some spirited work by the French in Q2 when they were only 1 down, then Aus scored 3 in the last 4 minutes of the quarter, and that was that.
AUS 8 goals from 10 shots
Unreal
ENG - WAL starting now.
That was quite spicy at the Commonwealth of you remember.
England score in under 30 seconds 😮
Big oof
Sheep in the mud
Wales has to crowd fund their travel. Perhaps they need crash out quick before the money runs out
crowd fund their travel? that means they be staying at places like premier inn equivalents. Someone defo about to over eat on the buffet and not be able to run properly

We've all been there
Not me.
I've never missed a stroke
100% no miss record

Eng currently 0 from 6 pcs in the first 20 minutes.
Eng referral for deliberately playing over back line denied but I've definitely had those given against me 🙁
11 pcs in first half, nine in the second until 20 secs to go
For eng
Hit the post!
0-0
Terrific game

Malaysia now two up, but 2 in the bin and NZ pull keeper

4-2 IND
So much possession, so many circle penetrations, but not much return really.

I don't know how he has scored 24
He was a center back
And he can't flick 😂
Hahaha
He practiced his finishing over the summer
He did tear his MCL or something a couple years back so maybe since he got back to hockey he has been upfront? 😂
UoN 6s are same level at KH1 (and top of their league)
M7 don't seem to be in the league at all
M7 just doing friendlies against themselves every week and lee Morton's brother is banging them in what a hero
ARG-FRA was 4-4 with 1 minute to go. France get a stroke an score. ARG restart and get a PC with 35 seconds to go. Gets reawarded 3 times. France break early. Another reaward. ARG level it at 5-5 with 5 seconds left.
ARG pc conversation rate is rubbish.
3 from 15
Fra 2 from 3

Tight high speed ENG-GER game, but Rushmere 3d's it past three German sticks and Wallace whammos it off the end of Rushmere's stick. Unbelievable goal.
woah, some fun hockey? what a revelation
England have been properly good in the tournament
damn noice#
Winner of this meets Australia in the semi, and I reckon England could do it
NED vs Korea later today. NED look amazing and should cruise to semi vs Belgium, and then to final.

Straight shove in the middle of the field. Really stupid card to get
Ruhr's back on the park, and Liam Sanford is flat on his face off the ball.
Gonzalo Peillat is such a shit open field player
Eng burned their review on a  5m call. Germany about to do the same
He's playing for Germany now?
yeah wait what
that's a good point
I know he's been playing there for ages
Yea, he stropped out of the ARG setup in 2018.
I'm surprised he can get in the team tbh
damn, was it that long ago?
Maybe caoch asked him to not be shit
Got German citizenship this time last year, and FIH gave permission for him to play
He's done fuck all in this game apart from two failed passes and a mistrap
Germany have had 2 pcs and I don't think he did either of those
Still 2-0 England. 4 minutes to go
Doesn't one of the grambusch brothers usually flick!
?
Stroke for Germany 😮
Is Florian Fuchs still playing?
Ruhr hits the bar
Apparently Florian Fuchs has completely retired from hockey
He's only 31
And he was one of the best players in the world a couple of years ago
Seems like a shame
Germany score with 2 mins 30 to go
Meanwhile Moritz furste is still playing in India
I didn't realise Germany won gold at both Beijing and London
Fuchs 116 goals in 239 international appearances
Imagine coming up against furste, it says here he's 6ft 3 and 89KG
He's a beast
Wallace gets a green. Knob
Furste 112 goals from 268 games from half back lol
Easier than coming up against me. 6 3 and 100kg!
He's probably a bit quicker
Germany scramble, Mesnick gives free out for danger but self refers
Commentators give it the shot on goal so how can it be dangerous
Marcin gives a stroke on the video referral!
Tom Grambusch to take it
Shit.

2-2 with 90seconds to go
Oosh
Shuffs?
Peillat finally does a thing and wins a pc

soo...
don't leave it on a cliff hanger?
Shuffles
Hockey is the real winner when it goes to shuffs
2-2 no misses so far
those footballers need to be taking notes
Goodfield fucks up the spin. Doesn't hook it properly
Germs go ahead
the fact that you can say 'the spin' and I know exactly what you mean is a travesty

NED haven't conceded a goal in the competition yet

Korea of the bar from a pc
Another Korea pc saved by the postman
I am assuming Netherlands are winning here?
it is mildly ambiguous
Just gone to 4-0
Korean own goal 😔
KOREA SCORE!
Suiii
Ned have fluffed a couple of pcs in this game
This one's OK and they score again 5-1
And that's it. NED go through to meet BEL
Korea made them work harder than the score suggests

Different commentator, same trope
Peillat, amazingly, has scored 2 pcs to bring Germany back to level it with Aus in Q4
AUS go ahead with 2m30 to go
Peillat scores another PC with 1m44 left
"Gonzalo the Great"
Ric Charlesworth more measured - "that's why they have him in the team"
Doesn't say "because there isn't another reason" but implies it
Zalewski gets a yellow 13 seconds to go.
Germany score! 6 seconds left
Australia refer but they're hoping

Any luck @447922463217?
Yup
He said I could replace the fan but that it would be quite awkward cuz pcu fans are non-standard and awkward
But since it has been running fine and doesn't make wierd noises that I should just continue using it
And cuz of its age if/when it starts to make funny noises because of the fan imbalance to just replace it
Unless I want to get technical with fan replacement
Noice
While I was there I grabbed a couple case fans because I noticed the one I had was not spinning properly
So for the first time, possibly ever, the pc actually has good air flow!
Since I only had one intake fan
It now has an intake and exhaust fan

Ive got a galaxy tab s4 - I have used it pretty much everyday at school for over three years
And I have never had a complaint about it
*I think it might be over four years actually, I don't remember
My only with is that maybe 14.6 inches is too big for reading, and that the S8 plus, which is 12.4 might be better from that point of view
Just got the ruler out. 14.6 diagonal is about A4 paper size
okay yeah
might be a bit unwieldy
The OnePlus has a 1.4 aspect ratio, which is close to the A size 1.414
The Samsung are 1.6

In the summer we should set up our own Lego universe server and all play it
I think my pc has just died
What's happened?
Last night on apex it just shut off
I assumed it crashed, no big deal. I went to sleep
I power it up this morning, hop into the firing range and the pc turns off again
I reboot, try again and it turns off again
I check the CPU and GPU temp and is hop into apex for a third time
Temps weren't super high or anything but it switches off
Now it won't turn on
Take it to your dudes round the corner
Yeah will do
I think it does have a fault, and even if you can diagnose you'll need the part
Getting them to find first won't cost much more than the part anyway
Ye, my guess is that the power supply has finally decided to give it up
But we will dee
*see
I will take it to them tomoz
When my graphic s card failed, I'd never have worked  it out.

Fair enough
Well I'll see what they say

At least I hope I don't need a new one
@447922463217
Try repairing the game first on steam
If you right click on apex and then click properties
And then local files
And then verify integrity of game files
My pc does not turn on
Oh
Like I can't get it to boot at all
Does it error code?
No
Nothing
As in
No lights
No fans
When you press the button literally nothing happens?
Yup
Sounds like it could be psu
That's my guess
I mean the PSU fan is missing a blade
But it hasn't made any noises that I've noticed
We will see
Well my pc is up and running again
Okay so I verified the apex files
All was wel
*well
Just played a match of Cod, I got half way through and the pc restarted

This is what it said after the restart
I restarted it again and it booted to windows with no issue
I would backup anything that you don't want to get wiped
I don't store any files locally really
Thought so
Hard disk failing?
My boot drive is an SSd
Although the games are on a hard drive
Could still be failing
But it would not explain the restarts would it
Maybe still have a chat with your dudes
Okay
Just dropped the pc into the shop. I will see what they say in a few days
Just had a call from the pc shop
Apparently the problem is my gpu
Uh oh
Yup
Big boy has packed in I guss
Rip
What are your options?
It's done so well for so long
They said the put my GPU in their test bench and it shut down basically immediately
I'm heading over to talk to them now
But I guess my options are just which graphics card do I want
That's what I was asking really
I don't know tbh
I guess a similar card shouldn't be too expensive
It's not like you need to go for the latest and greatest
No no
I will almost certainly go second hand too
👍I'm sure they'll see you right
So the power supply is fine
But the GPU is cooked
They have a new 3050 for 350
Or a 3060 for 430
Im just gonna go online see what I can get second hand
What did you have?
980 ti
It's old so really anything newer is probably better
Yea, so an entry to low-mid level card would poetically beat it right?
Probably
You don't need to go for a heavyweight replacement
No not really
I will have a search
Go and see what they've got
I might go AMD for the value?
I've got an AMD card in my desktop
It's quite old
No
Current low midrange I think
im looking at either a 2060 or a 5600XT
https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html
Compare it on here
They have every card
okay
Those seem to offer almost identical performance to what you get right now
The RX 5600XT seems a fair bit better to me
the 2060 12gb is a bit works then the AMD card but is still better then mine
what card do you think I should go for bean?
and how much do you think I should spend?
This message was deleted
Oh wait I was comparing with the 5700XT not 5600XT
actually the best deal I've seen is a 1080Ti for 190
Sounds good
although it is a 6 year old card, so not sure if it is worth getting a newer one just because it might last longer
okay okay I think I have narrowed it down
scrap the 1080ti
because passmark seems to weirdly inflate its score over other sites, and also it is really old
I would rather have a newer card
I am also pretty sure I wanna go AMD because they seem consistently cheaper then the NVIDIA counterparts
the RX6600XT seems like a good bet
This message was deleted
or the RX5700 XT
they would both be around 200
I messaged a guy on Marktplaats, says he would do a Gigabyte Radeon RX 5700XT for 180 Euros
That about as good a price as I can find for it
@447757499873 any objection before I buy it?
I don't really follow these things any more so I don't know
If it seems good price then don't see why not

Shame I won't be back in time to watch
What are you doing today?
We are in Groningen today
First game of the season
Blimey.
You show those posh boys
🐐
Put your sun cream on!
Yup. Was 30 degrees in Zwolle yesterday with the little ones
Hockey.nl says you're at Enschede not Grongingen
Good job you're not driving I guess
It's wrong
True 😂

It says we are at Groningen
I can't read
Noice
Did your kids start their season yesterday?
Yes
They lost 6-5
But came back from 5-1 down
So good effort
And we only had 1 sub
Yes, good work
They had 5
Good team talking Hal
You pleased with them, then?
Ye
They worked hard

Yeah
Well done
We had a triangular friendly yesterday. Very hot, quite hard work 🙂
Oof
Rough
Our Ladies 5s play against Nijmegen 25s😳
😮
How was your game?
We lost 3-0 😤
I just looked, Nijmegen have 11 mens and 28 ladies teams
Not including vets, or young adults (U21)
You annoyed about the result then?
Kinda. They were a good team and they played well. But it feels like half our team doesn't understand positioning or how to play/play against different defensive and attacking schemes
You can coach that though.
Very frustrating because it is the kind of thing that they should have learnt/be taught before entering H1 but they haven't yet
I know
Fair, yes
But we shouldn't have to
Not from scratch, no
Tweaks here and their, sure. But full on having to explain ground up is really rediculous
Did you have chances?
Because so much of that is experience as well. It cannot necessarily simply be taught
Yes, but no
We got in their circle
But not loads of really solid chances
It doesn't sound like a disaster. 3-0 isn't a drubbing, and if you're getting the ball in the D you've got things to work with
But I understand your frustration
No it wasn't a disaster, just frustrating
And they will learn too
So its not fundamental issues. Just understanding and experience
It'll come. Who have you got next week?
EHV
(Enschede)
Tough looking game for the kids

Not sure who stopped who?
Feel like those cows could have stopped him real quick
Did they run out of money or something then?

In AMSTERDAM?
Ikr

Oof

Good luck Hal
Haha! Will done!
Yeah great game today

You've got to pick a new stick, boys
/pick me/
Pick you a new stick?
Ritual velocity 75
Why that one?
Cuz its a good stick
I might buy myself one
Nice shape, good weight
Not too bendy
Good balance
Fairly good design
Not too stiff, not too soft
OK then.

No teas at Cardiff and Met. Absolute bullshit
I'm fuming
Score?
6 maybe - 1
Two and half hours each way and they can't scrape together a back of chips?
Biggest club in Wales with their blue pitch?

It was 5-1
I got called for breaking early and they scored of the reset 🙁
I hadn't stepped over, but "there was forward movement"
That is definitely how the rules work
Is it though?
until the ball has been played, no attacker other than the one taking the push or hit from the back-line is permitted to enter the circle and no defender is permitted to cross the centre-line or back-line
I was being sarcastic 😂

Damn
Chonky

Cardiff & Met photographer took a ton of photos, and in nearly everyone in in I look like I want to murder people

yep, it is different from your current one. However, it is the same as the one you had before the red one. It is a fairly relaxed shape so I would worry too much about pinging the ball in the air!
What did you get him @447922463217 ?
Ritual velocity?
Or response?
Velocity 75
Goated stick
ritual best stick brand @447922463217 ?
Either them or Dita imo
100%
Dita literally don't exist anymore
I'm the last Dita user
They did fall off big time tho
Like hardly see them now
You can still buy them at decathlon
Even though they're soo good iml
Imo
But only the shit one
*ones
Dita and ritual are the only brands where the sticks have been consistently good
Trye
*true
Y1 literally the worst stick I've ever ysed
Ritual literally don't make a single bad stick
Oh yeah
Gryphon broke quickly
I liked my compo1 adidas
I swear y1 sticks bend everyone you hit with them
They feel cheap
But don't like the shape of the back thing
Like it's weird for reversing
The old shapes were really nice
With the three grooves down the back you know
The Grays were okay but nothing special
Same with mazon
The rituals are really hard wearing too
Like I used the 55 for ages and then at the beach and shit it's still in good working order
The ritual sticks and some of the ditas are literally the only stick shapes I like
I don't like any others tbh
Yeah I think the Dita shape I use is very similar to the revolution shape
It's low without being shit for things which aren't flicking
Like some sticks are just dumb
Can't do anything with them apart from flick
The velocity is the nicest all round shape
It's I could only recommend 1 stick to anyone it would be the velocity 75

Mazons were good but not on the level as the ditas or the rituald

Yea, for time wasting. Obviously for you, they stop the clock then you have 40. For the Bean it'll be "hurry it up lads' and for me it's 'hang on ump, let me get my breath back"

Is he planning to go to Birmingham? Seems weird they'd take someone so young into the team otherwise

Same league as harbs

Harbs are Div 1 South
Mo Samak is the coach
Uob, Olton, Barford are Div 1 North
Samak is coaching UoB?
Yeah
Oh I take that back
Chris Davis is the 1s coach
Samak is 2s assistant
Rohit is also playing uob 1s
He is same age as caspar
And I think I've got leagues wing
And was also at Sutton
Harbs, UoB, Olton all Div 1 north
Barford got relegated so are Mids Conf
There is also a lad called Ollie in the harbs 1s team, he is same age as caspar and rohit
Harbs are div 1 north

Subaru and Porsche is interesting considering how few of those are on the road
At least round here would've thought Audi much more likely
27 quid to get the full paper 😡
Like no boy racers are driving Porsches because they can't afford them😂
Maybe they were fourth and that's too many to go in a headline
For me VW Golf drivers are pretty mental too
Us Skoda enjoyers are very sensible
particularly if they are pimped up...
Also kinda disagree with the conclusion they draw
Like when was the last time you saw a Subaru advertisement
Also where is Range Rover in all this? They might be the most aggressive drivers out there
Range rover drivers really do think they are the kings of the road
They do mention Subaru. The data they used was 2011 to 2015. Subaru spokesman said their range and advertising has changed since then

Wow, did you even get within 5m of him, or was it a terrible lob? 😂
Does it hurt?
Only looks like a bit of blood?
It's a bit uncomfy. It was glancing rather than full on, and it's scuffed me through the buff.
I think it's only done that because I'm already a bit scarred up there already
Both. I was probably only a couple of metres, which is why I didn't get out of the way
If he'd got it away quicker, it never would have happened at all
But he was setting for a flick, but I was almost there and he tried to scoop it over me <This message was edited>

I get it's a long trip from Cardiff, but they run 6 men's sides. I can't believe they couldn't have put together a team, even if it ends up being a bunch of juniors getting their first run out. It's piss poor
We did beat them 6-0 in the league, but I'm sure that's nothing to do with it 🙄

They're like normal differential equations except any calculus you do is with respect to Bt (Brownian motion) which is a random process
So Riemann integration (normal integration) doesn't work because how can you integrate with respect to something that is non-deterministic

You have to define a differenttype of integration

You frozen off today @447757499873?
Amazingly, our game today was on (although I didn't play) and we bagged another win
Yeah

That's cool
It's a left handed stick
I played against a left handed guy the other week who was using a keeper stick
What?
You mean like the curvy keeper sticks?
With a hook that went nearly all the way around, yep
Wow, I swear you cannot usually hit with them, because they are so thin that you will break them
You know how some left handed guys hold the stick the wrong way across their body and do a lot of little reverse lifts and things
Oh yeah
He just did that then
He was even more like that
Must be a nightmare to defend
Not too bad
We won 5-0 🙂
Oh noice
We're on a 5 game undefeated streak
Oof, promotion concerns?
They probably wouldn't break but you don't get any power
I doubt it, top two are v strong, but I don't think anyone would mind
Travel would be about the same, we'd probably stay up
And because we've only been in the league 3 years everyone would be mad for it

Their teas better be pretty spectacular.

Haven't played any hockey in nearly 3 weeks
Busy Christmas for you then
Yeah quite busy
Just fell of my bike twice in 200m
Literally just tipped over 😂
I put some Clipless pedals on my bike..m
Clip less moment
Classic
First time I've ever ridden them, and it was on my fixie 😂
Definitely didn't help




ah yes, the glorious city of richmond

hahaha

Legend
Since August.
Actually mainly August - 110 hours
So am I bringing Carcassonne with me over Christmas?
Yeah for sure
Dutch accents from people who arnt from around Arnhem are so hard to understand

Lots of hockey on the tv over the weekend.
Not in the Netherlands, because they've already qualified obvs 🙄

The UK version of Jeopardy with Stephen Fry as Alex Trebek is on ITVx 😮 <This message was edited>
Gonna give it a go
Titles are the same
ITVx app just as shit on the tv as on the tablet
Turns out Stephen is a fan of Kendrick Lamarr
Dude from Birmingham "went to the same school as Tolkien"
A doctor who went to Kes. What a surprise.
Everybody tanking on Final Jeopardy
Except me and the winner
Pretty good. Obviously not going straight into whatever Alex did, but pretty good
Nice
Could become a quiz staple of the UK
Still clinging on to the old high school then eh?

Ngl, semi an L from Bailey there. Dude goes crazy in 2023, literally no.1 in the world. Comes second is bloody west midlands champs 😂
I'd be fuming
And I'd have left it off the list 😂
Real 😂
3-2 loss for us yesterday 😢
Were 2-1 up too. One of our umpire's decisions are baffling a out half the time. He gave a short to them for what everybody else saw as a stiffarm push on one of our guys. Rewarded three times, ends in a stroke for foot on the line, they equalise.
Sometimes the game just gets taken away from you.
Didn't expect to get any pitch time, because I'm still not properly recovered but played about 25 minutes.
Gave away a short in the first minute
But did make a save of the line, to clear it.
Also actually skilled a couple of people out.
(You're both eligible to play for us, BTW. Just saying.)

Watching GB vs NZ in the Olympic qualifiers. Kane Russell still playing for NZ.
Mad that he's only 31. Been playing for NZ since 2012 😮
Simon Mason. Why do they keep hiring him? He is so bad.
I like him
When he's not waffling about the umpiring
I think he's more engaging than the vast majority of pros they sometimes have on
Ye tbf, just cuz he waffles absolute bollocks it makes the game more funny 😂
So apparently there are ticket to ride Spotify playlists?
That you are intended to play while playing the game
So yesterday, low drag flick, saved on the line by the corner man, but rebounds into the back of the keppers pad, and into the goal.
Really clear - there was a camera in the goal.
He had three attempts to describe it, and got it wrong every time.
Like not even close.
Maybe it's different when we watch together, but when I'm by myself it drives me bananas

My first goal yesterday
First time reverse! Nice!
Scored two tap ins and then one were I got the ball on the 2023 and dribbled it in along the baseline and slipped it under the keeper
That first goal - did the guy on the line get a touch of that the ball coming down off the roof of the net.
? P
He might have got a touch
But honestly not sure
Good effort by him if he did <This message was edited>

well so can that nurse by the looks of it
8:15 meet for a 12pm push tomorrow. Our away trips are such a ballache
I'm driving so reminded everyone to bring an activity for the journey.
Colouring in, something like that
No musical instruments though
Still, @447757499873 got to go all the way to Olton.
Still we're playing at Sophia Gardens so will deffo be a better pitch than Olton's

Oof
How'd you manage that?
Lifted ball caught my finger on the way through
😬
Got dimple mark on the side.

Ireland men are in the pro league 😮
Which Ireland?
All of it
Hugh...
Ireland takes a relaxed view of the border, and anyone born on the island of Ireland (or has parents/grandparents) is eligible
Ireland's first game is on Saturday vs Netherlands
Tough start
Netherlands, on the other hand have already played 4 times - 3 wins and a draw
What's your guess for how much Ireland get battered by?
And they're playing in Bhubaneswar!
That's very rough
4-1
To NL
Omg - NED on Saturday, the AUS on Tuesday, Spain on Thursday, India on Friday
Then fly to Rourkela, and play them all again the week after
Brutal.
😬
Negative motivation for that team right there
So Men's Pro League - Netherlands, Australia, Spain, India, Belgium, Argentina, Germany, GB
And Ireland
Ouch
No Pakistan then?
Pakistan have never been in the ProLeague
But they have been better over the last couple of seasons.
Hopefully they'll get there shit back together
Yea
Ireland replaced NZ
Oh wow, that's quite impressive actually
Yea, I guess it is
https://youtu.be/MBp48nj0x2Q?si=kIzxf63uvIOagtKZ
This is a hell of shootout

What were you doing at 2 in the morning, you sly dog you?
Walking to Upward
So I could get in a car to drive to Schiphol, so we could fly to Malaga
Ah
So the steps after that are car bounce not actual steps?
And the flat bit is the aeroplane
Yes I think so, at leaste some of those steps are car bounce
But post.plane ride they are all legit

China in second 😳
Come on
They look so much better.
Good for them
I know Alyson Anand left NED under a bit of a cloud, but she's really given the Chinese a kick up the arse
Oh yeah, she is their coach, I forgot that
Ric Charlesworth is in the coaching team too, apparently, and he's brilliant
Impressive
What's Super Pool E @447922463217?
The name of the league and then the pool that my team are in
The national league is called 'super C'
It's this something you qualified for from earlier, or is just a different competition?
No so we qualified for it by doing well in the first league (up to Christmas)
Then based of positions they put you in a new league
Noice. You'll be visiting some fancy clubs then 🙂
So place 1,2 and 3 in our league (Zwolle, Nijmegen and us) got put into the under 14s national league called super C
So theoretically, if we do well in our new.league and get to the play offs. Then win the play offs.
national champions of u14s
Yup
It was actually 5-1 - got away from them a bit at the end of Q4, but made NED work really hard.

stroke that also got Croon a 10 minute yellow. Had one off the post too <This message was edited>
NED got 3 pcs and scored from 2

Fantastic umpire referral in this weeks Aus-Esp game. There's a little bit of off-ball nonsense, which the umpire doesn't quite see so refers to the video ump. He has a look and comes back with "I have some advice for you. Tell them both to get on with the game"
Is that the young Tom Morris?

Amazing!
You got a friendly this evening then?
Yeah

What's the tea?
Bread and cheese?
Some soup, bread, dutch spiced bun things, and some yogurt/cream pudding <This message was edited>

Ngl, I miss just getting gives a massive bowl of chips
Ah yea. Cheese for breakfast out there
(With bread)
Chip butties are just such an elite tea

I was just added to this group? 😂
It's a really big quiz, or it's all about gorillas?
Neither 😂
Just a quiz I think
Boo

Olton are already relegated
But why didn't boots turn up?
No clue
They upped the non turn up loss to 8-0?
Or are you saying metaphorically they didn't turn up
Metaphorically. Not turning up is only 5-0
I thought so 😂
Why didn't boots just not turn up then is the question...
Yea. If boots had won they'd be third, but now they're sixth and they've completely shafted their already bad gd. Olton have been rubbish all year. No way they should have won, let alone by 8
And it's really bad for Olton as a club that their 2s will be Mids 2 next year. It's too big a jump from their 2s to 1s
Massive yea
Although they were in mids 2 five or so years ago
But 5 or so years ago, they were pretty much the only national league side in Birmingham. Not even close to true now
fair
Yep apart from UoB who don't really count
Lichfield were also in and out of NL but Olton were the defacto nl side
Also @447922463217 thorney is playing for Harborne 2s
How and why?
Not sure but he looking a bit tubby
And not just a one off either
Have seen him every time we've seen harborne 2s since xmas
Maybe he took some time out last season or something?

Facts lads
A change has taken place in the JO14 Super competition pool E.



 JO14-1 will be withdrawn from the Super competition.  This means that all results already achieved and planned matches against GHBS JO14-1 will be canceled and the teams will have a free playing weekend instead.

inue with the remaining 5 teams;
Just had an email from the fixtures Sec.
GHBS, who lost 17-0 last weekend have withdrawn 😂
Our opposition due this weekend have sacked off
Forgotten when I last played
Don't know which way to to hold my racquet


Already?
Only 2 games left
Fucking heroes!
Possibly less in their lexus
League
Yea, two more weekends for them. We've got 4!
Apart from Chen's brothers and Sameer, that's basically the same team as last year except for me and Grogan. and we couldn't win anything
In fact it's basically the same team as the last several years :)

almost certainly
let me look
Is Jane still in the 1s? 😂
No
I know two of the girls in the team
Although Jane nor her daughter are on the team
You deleted this message
Ellie Mae not on the team?
Ni
*no
Is she at university or something?
Oh yeah maybe
I think she is year bellow me actually
I thought she was two years bellow
But I don't think so
I think just one
Then yes she would be
Ye she's in Nottingham
Standard
Almost close enough to stay with the club
True 😂
Nottingham Ladies are prem?

Dunno?
It's a very Dutch email. No messing about, just straight into the headhunting
I assume you're flattered but no?
Yeah they play 4th class
So three leagues lower then us 😂
Ballsy
If you want to play low level hockey there'll always be a place for you at Kings Heath ♥️
I respect the attempt 😂
For sure
Have you told anyone at Upward? Did everybody get one?
I'll shut up - must be nearly time fit your team talk. Good luck jongen
@447757499873 Give Hampton a slapping 👍
It's not even 3 leagues lower really
It's three league structures
Cuz each class has the pools
So it's even lower than fhat
And even then they still manage to have three pitches. So jealous


They couldn't buy a win, and now three wins in a row by 8, 6, & 7 goals 🤔
One of our boys at A&E 😢
Take a ball to head. I'm assuming he's been split open
He is 😢

Are your stitches out Hal?
Yes, on Tuesday


When you have to move the ball 5m before going in the circle, is it distance from the starting position or the distance travelled by the ball? <This message was edited>
Eg can you do Indian dribble on the spot, in which the ball travels a total of 5m but never actually more then 1m from the original starting position of the ball?
Ball movement
On the wrong end of a decision, or coaching point?
No just the umpire from a game i was watching earlier called it for distance from the starting point and i didn't think he was right but wasn't sure
So Rhys, our guy who got hit on Saturday - he was meeting someone about 5 or 6m in the D. Opposite blast it from top if D, into his head. It caught on the top of the forehead, just below the hairline.
Umpire awards a short
Which is just wrong.
Short is infected, no shot from the top. They passes it around, gk comes out to try and make the save, striker hits it into roof off net.
Umpire awards goal.
On top of that, opposite had forfeited their 1s game and was fielding a curiously strong 2s.
Some teams are just a bunch of cunts
Who's trying to watch a thing on Prime?

don't worry tho
I got it sorted

Have either of you used Kagi?
No?
It's a paid for search engine. Thinking of signing up
Family plan is $20 so I'll do that if you think it'll be something you'll use
What are the benefits over Google?
I've not even heard of it before
No ads
No boosting their own results (because they don't have any)
Personalisation - can raise or lower the priority of particular sites, for instance
And lensing
So you might be searching for something, and apply the Academic lens to focus in on published papers, say
There are precanned lenses, but you can also define your own
It's a pretty advanced technique actually
Kagi.com
Give it a spin
Alright sounds cool
👍
the archive.org search lens is pretty dope
and the academic lens is like if google academic search was absolute ass

Welp, guess NL dont want be leaving my bag in there...
Snag a shirt!
Most of it was just random kit today. Somedays it is all NL blue and orange kit. Maybe then ill try and bag some?

Either of you know anyone who uses a Ritual glove?
My glove is absolutely dying, and so maybe it's time to get a new one
Know anyone? I been using ritual gloves for like 5 years
Love them

OK, nice
I can check the size of mine to give you a guide also

Goated @447922463217
it's actually very clean icl
Why the goat though
apparently the goat was originally on the cadbury crest
The pears, I kind of get
Although obviously I'd rather be a bear than a pear
yeah but the pears were already on the old KH crest
King's Heath was in Worcestershire when the club was founded
Yo that's so fucking fire
Wtf
I want kit
not sure when kit is coming
might not be til next year because of supplier contracts
Well when they order kit, let me know
Blue and Gold home colours, and burgundy away colours?
It was gonna be something like that for this season
Then once the new kit comes I'm not sure
Need to go back to the old style checkerboard
But I imagine it'll be one strip is blue with gold trim and one is burgundy with gold trim
Cuz remember that blue and gold are Bournville's second and tertiary colours

On the one hand, them muscles
On the other, what the hell is my other leg doing?
You look special as hell

All.love and respect to the boi tho

This keyboard is your old keyboard, the one you gave me ages ago 😂

Bros salty
Don't think it's from us, but it's absolutely true
Damn, that's semi peak
I was absolutely done in by the end of the game. Their left wing would come right across into the D, switch with the centre forward, switch back, then quite often go behind the goal to try and make you lose track of him
Lots of running, but kept him under control 😉

Jesus dad
That's just from running around?
Little toe deflected short corner hit early in the game
Don't know about the big toe
Okay so it's 16m hit for the defence.
by a defender. The aerial goes into the chest of an attacker standing 5m from where the ball was taken.
oul as the ball is dangerous. Is this a short corner?
The question question comes down to does the offense occur where the ball was taken or where it hit the player?

As we can see this is rule 9.8, but how would this be applied in this case?
Did the umpire feel it was deliberate? If yes, short and consider a card. If no, free hit attack
No, not deliberate
But the reasoning was that the danger occured as the aerial was taken, therefore the foul occured in the circle
You didn't say that it was taken inside the circle.
It was on the line
Therefore inside
But in that case, yes a ahort is a decent call
Especially if the umpire says short because....
But did the foul not occur where the forward stood, which would be outside the circle
The foul did not occur where the ball was taken from
OK, I've changed my mind o this over the years. If the ball was only ever going to hit the player, it's where it was played.
It's the origin of the ball
So where the ball was hit from
Because the dangerous action is chucking the aerial
So the lesson is, bring it up
See i dont understand this. Because, for example, if the attacker had been 15m away, instead of 5m.
layed the ball at chest height, but obviously it hit the attacker 15m from where the ball was taken.
n that the foul occured where the ball was hit from?
idn't occur anywhere near the location of the hit.
In the case you described, where the attacker is 5m away, the defender is choosing to play an aerial when he obviously has to get the ball well clear of someone stood in front of him
Get that wrong, it's dangerous from the moment out left the stick - because the attacker is going to have to evade straight away
The 15m case is more difficult. As an umpire, it's be unlikely to bring it all the way back, because it isn't obvious straightway the ball with hit the attacker
Hmmm... Fair enough. Admittedly almost everyone else (other then me and the guy who took that aerial) said they thought it was a short corner.
00% sure I agree.
o understand what your saying
If he's 15m away argument is that it's not dangerous since attacker had plenty of time to react
Yes but that does the offense. That is literally evasive action

@447889953414 on the subject of analysing scores. How difficult would it be to scrape the scores off the KNHB website and automatically input them into an excel sheet? <This message was edited>
Dunno, but probably fairly straightforward
Might try
You might want to look up datassette
Might help you with it
Okay

So all of the advertising banners have been temporarily covered covered up
I'm assuming NL are filming something or playing a game or something, so they need all the official sponsors 😂
They have done a very comprehensive but quite DIY job of it all 😂
Gonna snag that NL number 4?
I think they have some nl kit on our changing room at the moment
But they might not be very happy 😂
Probably not with the risk
Maybe in a couple of years 😜

why would you need to leave on the Friday if it's on saturday
I'm down
No it's not about leaving on the Friday. I know we are leaving Saturday morning. I'm just not sure how early, and what the logistics for it are
But I'm definitely down to go too
it'll be finished by 9:30
Oh tbf then, that's quite chill
I will let you know for sure on Friday evening
Is that when you're going back to Birmingham from Hescwm?
What about you @447757499873? Or are you staying longer?
So we could do something like all go back to Birmingham on the Friday
t.
Harry heads off on Saturday.
Me and Bean go to Milans than head back to Dinas
Or something
Anyway, I'll get the tickets and if it all falls over it'll be easy enough to offload then
Them
We're in hescwm in June?
Dunno about July
Me neither 🙂
Great, sounds good to me
Me neither 😂
Hollies stand?
Yea, why not
OK, I had to allocate your tickets separately.
What a pita
what does that mean?
You're going to get emails to setup your own account on Edgbaston.com and you can access your ticket from there
okay, but we will be sitting together?
Actually, just ignore their emails.
I'll sort it out from here this evening.
oooohhhh pita is 'pain in the ass', not a typo of pity <This message was edited>

Anyway, Bears vs Pears, 18:30, 12 July

I made dhal with split peas by accident today
Not my finest moment
Green split peas?
From a tin?
no dried
Still ugh
A bit gloopy?
they were kind of yellow in colour
no, they just didn't soften
Oh right
even after like 45 mins cooking
Not chana dal? Yellow split peas?
They do take a while
just regular dhal
should have used red lentils
Chana dal is what the split peas are called?
For some reason my top image search is Dutch

nope, they were not them
Do you whisk your dal?
no?
As it starts to soften, instead of stirring with a spoon
Get in there with a whisk
It helps to break the lentils down
so they were in a container labelled in german
the german word translated to 'shelled peas'
(I did not buy them)
(they were just in the house)
Bad luck 😢

Facts

Almost as long to play as the actual war took to fight
2100 minutes? Wtf
I read more details - that's just one of the scenarios in the box
There's a whole campaign
That's is old school 70s style wargaming right there.

@Beaner Roger might be in touch to see if you fancy some summer league
Yeah he sent a message earlier
I'm doing Bournville and also beacon with Abu already
So probably won't
Fyi, blues got relegated to league 1

Follow the unbelievable amount of cope

Wanna see if it is possible to get play by play data?
@447889953414
Yes
Thanks

Both me and pieter (the other defender) got sent so damn hard on this one 😂😂


Maybe they don't know what migrating means
Send them to Rwanda
It's your Mumster's birthday on Friday laddos
I am aware, should we do anything?
If you wanted to send a card, it probably needs to go tomorrow, that's all
I assume you'll be sending her a 9 hour long video anyway
Precisely!

Not from you i suppose m

Also feels very early for summer league already
Nah that's Matt
He's getting married in 2 weeks 😬
Wife defo mad as hell 😂
ouch
You could see it
You could see the bone slightly poking out
Not through the skin or anything
But under the skin
What happened? Knocked over or tripped or something?
Defender accidentally clipped
They're legs got tangled when they were running next to each other
oof

Hahaha what
Any context
Nope
I got sent it by a guy at the club 😂
WUT
Tbf I don't think there's anything in the rules to say the umpire can't hoof the ball out of play

Are you busy on Saturday @447922463217? You could hop on the train to Antwerp for Belgium-India and be back in home in time for a late dinner
Got the kids to coach
Home vs Hurley
Antwerp pb not until 15:15
Could do both?
Although I'm watching yesterday's BEL-IRE and Ireland are 1 up at the end of Q1
2-0 at end of Q2 😮

In the latest Proleague weekend, Ireland lost twice to ARG, although one of them was 4-3 to a last second goal after being ahead twice, but beat Belgium twice 2-1 and then 4-1. <This message was edited>

They're both in the Olympics and their opening game is... against each other 😮

Good effort
I'm watching the T20 from last night. Isa introduces  Vaughan, who looks smug to be described as a former England Captain, then Jimmy, who looks embarrassed to be called England's greatest ever fast bowler.
Just another example of why Jimmy is the GOAT and Vaughan is a cunt

Sure thing....

Incredible scenes
Absolute village 🤣
How did they score nine of 1 ball?
8 wides, then nick a single?
"Of Wedgwood's eight runs, five of them were extras, coming via four leg byes and a wide."
How did they survive 10 overs is what I want to know
Just watching BEL-ESP proleague from the weekend. Spain gk Revere takes a Tom Bone drag flick to the helmet _and it breaks his throatguard_ <This message was edited>

I love this @447889953414
Are you cyberstalking me @447922463217?
My bio from the year before had the cycling bit and then "He was the 2017 Player of the Season for Kings Heath Hockey Mens IIIs."
So I'm trying to tell a little story for those paying attention
I hate writing these bios, but I have latitude at ACCU. Most people's are really bad though.
How is Tom boon after getting slammed in the face?
What?
In the match we watched before
He got hit in the face
By his own boy
Oh yea. Well fine I guess, since he played this weekend.
Our boy PRoper took a ball to head on Saturday. Looks like it caught him just above the left eye.
I'm watching Bel-Aus from yesterday. Aus went 3-0 in first half, Bel have made 3-3 in Q3. It's a real ding-dong

I think he's used a CV template for Word

Incredible bants
Bro had been watching too much football...
Watching China-Argentina women. China leading 1-0 from Q1. With 5 seconds to go, Chinese defender attempts to clear over the sideline, but gets it wrong. PC award for deliberately playing over the back line. Alyson Anand going bananas on the touchline. Arg score from the PC, and go on to win the shoot out. 🤦

Amazing last few minutes of GB-Ind women from to  yesterday. GB scored first but are 2-1 with time running out. GB yank keeper, immediately get a pc and score. Gk back on. GB get another pc and score again do 3-2 up. Now India pull Savita. Final 2 mins very end to end
Cheekiest shuffle you'll see, two saved penalties, and some crazy gk shenanigans https://fih.app.link/OMGfybEkiKb

Bean a keeper named Xavier
Played some of the tournaments
A year or two younger then me
Chubby guy
Training with us tonight
Played at Beacon
What's he doing out there?
And kalsa i think
Studying in Amsterdam
😂
OK, so what's he doing out there?
Hes played mens county
He is used to commuting 😂
Does he not know there are lots of clubs in Amsterdam?
He got offered ahbc 12s
And played some english prem last season with cardiff and met 😂
So not quite his level
Oh, H12s not J12s 😮
Is English or is he Spanish?
English
And he was travelling down from Birmingham or Walsall or something to play M1s at Cardiff and Met as a 17 year old?
And he's come down to Upward to see if you like each other, and maybe play H1 with you?
https://eurohockey.altiusrt.com/players/42376
Dude played Euro indoor with C&M
Ah, he's at Cardiff Met University
You deleted this message
Watching more proleague
All the Germans singing the anthem except Peillat
Wonder if he even speaks German
Nah he went to uni for a year in Cardiff or something
Not too sure but he didnt seem fussed about it
He was good tbf
Large kid
But light on his feet
Is he on an exchange or something, or has he changed university?
No, he dropped out
Started a 5 year masters course in Amsterdam
Blimey
If he's going to play at Upward he's going spent all his time on the train!
Although was a bit like 'yeah, its a course, i dont dislike it' basically just said he came for hockey
True 😂
@447757499873 ?
Might be summer leaguing
You can't be the only club he looking at, I guess?
Did he know you were at Upward? Or were you all wtf when he turn up?
Anyway, you know what I think of Cardiff and Met. No tea for Xavier
Ye i was like 'i recognise you'

Nah
I know who you mean but don't know know him

Terrance pieters not in NL selection for paris 😳 <This message was edited>
blimey
They've been talking a lot about how strict the Olympic squad sizes are, and I think there are more than a few coaches having to make hard choices
It's like a squad of 16, with three reserves
or something
He tore a ligament in his knee earlier in the year, but it says he trained with the dutch squad last week
and the reserves don't even get to stay in the Olympic village unless they get called up
Ah right
I remember him playing proleague earlier this year
Has Xan de Waard been selected for the Women?
Yes, she has. Oof
L
Bandurak not playing in paris?
Nope
No Brendan Creed either
I think I'd have taken Creed over Liam Sanford
And I'm surprised Ames is in the squad because I think he's only just come back from injury
But GB Men are a really strong squad. Definite medal contenders
Women haven't been playing as well as a they look like they should, if you know what I mean.
Classic issues
Quite surprisingly, Schiphol seem to use windows machines for all there digital signage
I assume it's crashed?
Windows has clearly died/pushed an update and a load of the displays are blue screens or account loading screens
Photo please 🙂
Yes


Nice
Walking through kings heath, saw abother islabike road bike in the wild
Just seen bruno, had a nice little chat
Also saw jude earlier
Just seen george Harrison
Lucy's brother
Working in Asda
Playing at beacon now with abu

New Dutch away kit is not good
White shirts, sky blue shorts
Ueah they are a bit boring
I mean germany isnt exactly fancy, in triple black
That Ned number 14, with a headband and his shirt tucked in looks like a knob 😂
Yo dad that PC referral where the onfield umpire overrules the Video ump is nuts
Thought @447889953414 ?
At 1 hour in
(to the VOD)
Personally me and bean think the vid ump is correct
I think the on field ump is correct
She said that she blew while the ball was still in play, so under the new rules it's a reset
That's happened more than once this proleague
Damn
So what are the new rules.
It's a recent change.
Video ump now gives advice rather than decision, so on field can always over rule
Here, because the whistle went without a valid reason while ball was in play, the pc is not complete. Therefore reset
If the ball had gone dead, it's different
The pc was still in play technically yes
But the corner was effectively dead
I would say
Doesn't matter - ball was live when the whistle went
On field ump was clear on that point
If the ball was dead or had gone five from the circle the pc is over, so depending on situation and when referral is requested could be pc award, free  out, or bully
Fair enough

Damn
Thats so cool
I think they mean to watch the footie
Thats not cool
Coffees in 10 mins remember 😉

Rip
Harry don't go on the toilet
Think my machine has killed its graphics card again
Fucks sake
What makes you think that?
I'm plugging it into the monitors but they aren't turning on
You definitely plugged into the monitors?
I think I unplugged something by accident
I didn't know what it was
But I definitely unplugged something I think
So have a check and make sure it's all plugged in properly
It is too new to die, surely?
You unplugged a load of stuff, but that was the work machine and it's fine
It's my own machine that seems poorly
Oh
That's a bummer

I haven't turned that machine on since I took it up there
Maybe somethings worked loose
Bean doesnt think so
But i think they might be his
He is have doubts, can you bring the cables anyway
We will check when we get home
I do not recognise them and they were under a blanket
And Bean brought his own monitor....
Oh yeah, defo beans. Can you also bring the blanket?
Yes, he has that tho
Bean has just taken the wrong exit at the cross hands roundabout, three times....
Ffs
Make sure the bed is made up

4tb HDD would've been that amount less than 10 years ago
Need to put more storage in the mini-PC so your Mumster can fill it up with videos to Hal
Lol
No cap
You mans wanna play Carcassonne tonight with me and gabbi (4 player with expansions)
i'm hockeying tonight
sorry fella
Tomoz?
could possibly do tomorrow yeah
although I wanna get in this tournament games
Btw any thoughts...?
That's now how we play it, no. We usually score once the feature has been scored but if that's the way it works in the app then that must be the way!
Yup
Yep

You've never seen Aliens have you?
no
https://youtu.be/aCbfMkh940Q?si=3nPkvNiU2WD3yM_r
You should it's jolly good.
is aliens the ridley scott horror film?
or is that alien
Alien is Ridley Scott
Aliens is James Cameron
ahh
But before he was "James Cameron"
yeye
Might be his best film. That or The Terminator.
Got sloppy once he had all the money
I'm not a big fan of titanic but have heard Avatar is legitimately amazing
People don't talk about it
It was a massive hit, but where's the pop cultural footprint?
that's true
But if I say "I'll be back"
but you could say that the impact on filmmaking technology sort of counts?
true
Well, you don't need have gone to the cinema in the 80s to know that
but also everyone knows that scene from titanic too
The prow of the ship?
yeah
I'm the king of the world
That's because every chap want to grapple with Kate Winslett
And all the ladies wanted to be grappled by little Leo
also draw me like one of your French girls is pretty famous
yeah true
But nothing from Avatar
The Abyss
I do think it's quite mad
True Lies
that a film that at the time was the highest grossing film EVER has had no discernible impact on popular culture
And ZoenSaldana doesn't get lead roles.
she was major character in guardians of the galaxy though
She was part of a group cast, and had to wear antennae
tbf she was the most normal out of all of them apart from chris pratt
like at least she doesn't look like a tree
or a raccoon
or a rock
All most people theyll go Chris Pratt, that wrestler, the tree, the racoon, and that woman, oh what's here name
I think zoe saldana is the most nameable out of all of them in it apart from chris pratt
She's made more box office than any woman apart from ScarJo
mainly because Bradley cooper doesn't look like Bradley cooper
Oh yea
I'd forgotten he's a big star now 🙄
I still think of him as the side kick in Alias
former sexiest man on earth too!
multiple years in a row I think too
He's no George
Id swap sides if George turned those eyes on me.
But little Bradley? Sorry fella
George is the goat
but I think Bradley is up there
Thierry Henry?
apparently Paul Rudd was sexiest man alive in 2021
Wut?
I know
it's a sorry state of affairs
https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/sexiest-man-alive-list-people-b2444015.html
a lot of theirry's sexiness comes from his accent imo
and his mannerisms
he's also a good looking chap
It's a package
There are some poor choices on that list
Matt Damon?
He's your best pal
Not sex idol
yeah I know
looking at it there's some bad choices
like Matt Damon is a good looking chap but he's not 'sexy'
like you say he's a nice guy, he's your boy
he's wicket smart
wicked
Dwayne Johnson too?!
like bruh
Every one says Chris Hemsworth is lovely, not sexy
The Rock. Hard no
I think women might have a word with you on this
surprised Michael b Jordon is not on the list after black panther tbf
JOHN LEGEND
that's gotta be the worst on the list
Awful
I'm think specifically of a chat appearance by all the women in Ghostbusters
They were all "Oh, he's so sweet, he's just so lovely"

(new usb hub in the way because don't know where the one I had has gone. Possibly one of you has it, which is fine)
Hmm, wondering if the fan starting them stopping is because the machine is stuck trying to boot
although the other fans aren't doing it.
Ah well, will fine out later if the usb dongle can help
If does turn out to be the card it's an AsRock RX550 2Gb, so hardly going to break the bank
It was inner tubes 🙄
Took under a minute to install my 4TB disk in the tiny computer
Obviously...
Obvious now...
My computer is definitely poorly 😢 <This message was edited>
Don't know if I can be bothered to get out fixed. Might get myself another little pc, or maybe do what I used to do a few years back and get myself a fancy docking station for the XPS
One of your guys could have it, maybe, and get it sorted?
It's quite old at this point too
For something of similar power you could probably pay not too much and get something much much smaller and power efficient
Can you send a screeny of system info?
I'll have to dig it out - it's got a fairly monster cpu
Yeah but nearly 10 years ago now
Iirc you have a 5820k or something like that
It was the power I was thinking of. Not so much for the running cost, but because the heat does build up in the office
Ahh I see
Yeah I have the same problem in mine 😂
It's also entirely likely that when I hand in my cards at Symmetry they won't want their machine back
Or they'll sell it at some token price
That's a 12core thread ripper with 32 gig or something daft <This message was edited>
Noise too. Work pc is especially noisy
I really like the little one I've bought. Putting in the new disk was undo case, slide into holder, close case. Job done
https://uk.store.asus.com/asus-nuc-14-pro-kit-240465750-90ar0062-m00050-1.html
something like this with the ultra 7 cpu option would be probably between 2 and 3x as quick as your desktop
Right? Even with the 7, it's not expensive. Memory and ssds are so cheap now, you can go large on both
Yeah 700 quid and you could just pop it on your shelf
I think that unless you're gaming it's pointless buying a tower PC with how powerful little NUCs and things are nowadays
Yep, I agree
It's kinda funny
Both of us have beefy cooling and things for our computers
Which is good because it means the CPU and GPU don't get too hot
But it just makes the room really hot instead 😂
So what are the specs of the pc?
I'll have to check latet
Gabs is looking at getting a cheap desktop. Her crappy mac struggles to run her 27 inch external monitor.
icking up a second hand office pc from CEX for a couple hundred or similar

Yeah will do. But let me know what you decide to do with your PC tho 👍

I don't understand why I can't just get the number
Ewing as though I won't be wearing it at the same time as someone else
because that's how the game works :)
And what exactly am I bidding for then
the number
It will be yours
Yes but what am I bidding
Like money
Or what
yes

Goes into club funds
Okay
What numbers are available
Don't know
just pick an alternative
I'll try and get 0 for you
I mean, I can afford it 🙄
I don't want you to spend extra money

What was your number @447922463217?
56
Cool
0 or 00? @447757499873
If 0 is taken then I could have 00
No, it's just what would you prefer
0
👍
Did you look at that pc spec I sent?
Looks good!
Going to spend the money then
Oh, and I've got someone at Symmetry for you to speak to if you'd like
james@jamtho.com
If you email him, saying who you are, you can arrange a call
Or would you like me to do the introduction?
I'm happy to email him
How well do you know him?
Oh yea, we are proper work chums
So what does he do at symmetry?
I wouldn't have asked him otherwise. He's done lots of different things, and he's been here a lot longer than I have.
He was the person who did my interview 🙂
Ahh okay cool, yeah sounds good! Will send him an email
Have you mentioned to him that I might be getting in touch?
What's most likely to happen is that he can give you a much better picture of what Symmetry does, but if you want deep detail of, say, what a researcher does, he'll hook you up with someone else
Yes, I asked him if it would be OK. That's how I have his personal email rather than corporate
Okay sounds great! Thanks dad ❤️
I've added discovery+ to our Prime Video so we get all the Olympics
Hockey starts on Saturday mornibg
Thats fire
Thanks 👍
Don't know how well Prime Video will do with actually letting you see the schedules, so you might have to check Eurosport.com to see what's on when
Then, hopefully, you can find it in the prime app
Eurosport will cover all of all the sports live and on demand, but BBC only have a tiny bit of it, and will concentrate on British athletes
Started the Rugby 7s already 😮
And the football, but who watches Olympic football?

This pitch is ugly

No, making pancakes but will catch up asap
Mum says any luck with sausages?
Have not been out yet
Ah okay, well no spoilers from me then
Do we have to go to M&S?
That's the sausages we've been using since cauldron stopped making theirs
There's an M&S in Weston-super-Mare
It's on your way out of Brean, I think
Or at least not far out of your way

I think we can say Max will be full hairdryer in the changing room
Argies not good?
He's managing Spain 😂
Lol
Spain had 60% of tbe possession, but lost 4-0 to GB
Argentina lost 1-0 to Australia. Aus looked OK. ARG looked boring
NED 5-3 over South Africa, which is a surprisingly good result for SA. I wouldn't have been been surprised by a 5-0
The SA goal keeper looks like he is wearing Kings Heath kit
Just started watching gb sa
If you want Simon Mason speaking his brain switch to the BBC
SA looking pretty good
GB not good at doing stuff in the final third
Same yesterday
Non of their goals yesterday were proper open play tho
But that's why Furlong's in the team, to chuck those drah flicks
Got to think SA will flag in Q4. Tempo is so high
Shipperly did draw that foul, but surprised no card
Points left on the table there
Just watched the 100 breast

Poor performance imo
New machine is so smol and quiet
22 Cores, 64 GB, 5Tb of disk in a box the size of a very small box
Amazing
(Just checked my symmetry machine - 48 cores, 128 GB. Absolute monster)
How big is it roughly?


The one on the right is the ordinary one that does the email and Nextcloud. It's fanless, but so has space for an extra SSD without going taller
I mean, tiny
On the left cost 1400 inc VAT, on the right about 500 in vat
Maybe a bit more because of the extra SSD I added
It's more than enough computer for most things
Wow that's amazing
It barely looks bigger than one of those active USB hubs

haha yeah
Omg its tiny!
watching the GB SA replay
classic 'we apologise for any fruity language you might have heard;

https://youtu.be/IMbBxMrIFjQ?si=_TaYHGxaxvCFIT0K
What you don't see here is how far ahead and how comfortable Koretzky looked after pidcock's puncture
On the Eurosport when he got a puncture they almost sounded as though it would be essentially impossible for pidcock to come back unless Koretzky got a puncture too or something similar
A bit before the start of that video, he overtook Koretzky but then on the next climb Koretzky absolutely blitzed past him and it looked like pidcock's legs were gone
And then on the slalom section it was like he found an extra gear from somewhere

Kelly and simon say it is a must watch...
Gonna watch it this afternoon
Wow
Unreal
Both of you must watch

Which match?
India-GB
Please watch it
Its nuts
All the quarters have been nuts
Peillat is the only player in the German team who doesn't sing the anthem 🤔
Only 9 teams in our league this year. 6 week layoff over Christmas 😔
Sounds like nazi protest
I wondered if he doesn't actually speak any German
I would expect so
China beat Australia in the women's!
Heroes


On Eurosport they have these little things with people trying different Olympic sports. I've just watched one about climbing, but one of the people trying it is Nile Wilson, former Olympic gymnast and still in incredible shape, and guess what? He got straight into it 🙄
Did you see that in order to not get disqualified, a Belgian shot putter did the hurdles haha
At this Olympics? I know things like that have happened in the past
Maybe it wasn't this one
Saw it on yt
But could've been from previous olympics
Europeans I think. If the squad didn't put up a competitor, they were disqualified or something

I have watched. @447922463217?
Yeah, i watched it with bean
Can't believe it
"German efficiency"
Harry and I thought that the Indians ran out of legs and ideas by the 4th quarter
The 'lead' climbing as a part of the combined 'boulder and lead' climbing event is very impressive
Yea, I've got it on now
Did you watch Ned-Arg women?
yeah, almost all of it
missed the last 10 mins or so
but I watched arg get their shit clapped in the first half
Aint nobody stopping the Dutch
looked like they were school kids
but did slightly better 3rd quarter
Veenendahl had a great game in goal
Just watching the track cycling now
These boys are cranking up to 77kph+
yeah, the women were at 60+ yesterday
The track bikes look so fragile
I feel like those guys could just rip them apart

"A lovely reach around"

Spoilers but you've got watch the China-Belgium shoot out
Chinese girl biffing the belgian
Love to see it
I caused similar levels of tension in our match tonight
What did you do?
Basically I lifted my stick out of a really bad tackle from their guy
And he went down
And everyone thought I'd hit him in the head
But he actually did his ankle at the same time
So it looked way worse than it was
Who were you playing for?
Beacon Vs Hampton
That'll be why they thought you'd hit him the head. Standard Beacon behaviour
I was playing for beacon
Unless you're saying that's what they do
Exactly
Ah you got hit by the Aldridge and Walsall guy huh?
Maybe they're better now, but Aldridge & Walsall were a bunch of cunts and I hated playing them
Their not the ones in beacon team lol
Streetly didn't exactly have a reputation as a friendly and welcoming club either 😂
Ngl fellas, watching the track sprints from last night is better than working

Nope
We are watching it on my laptop now
Who pressed the wrong button to put the water on 😂

@447889953414 have you watched it?
Did you watch the whole game?
I have
Omg
Unreal
Blaak the big cheese
Not seen him do a better shootout
Dude was on fire
Literally
I wonder if he'll be retiring too? He's 36, so won't make another Olympics
The shushing was naughty
True
Crazy shuffles tho
Yea, the last one was so good
True
Differt
*different
I said to Harry I imagine it must be that the keeper was chatting during the game or something
Dannenberg's first two saves were great, and then he just couldn't get a pad on anything
Or said something to him before the shuff or something
Did you see Brinkman taking to Wellen afterwards?
Which is what I'd be doing as a keeper
But I'd also then do that as a player
I was going to say
Yeah saw them chatting
Have you still got Floris on your phone? You should say congratulations?
How often are you going to be able to congratulate an Olympic Gold medalist while he's still in his pants in the changing room?
Hahaha
True
So do it
His skill bringing down that aerial was insane
Sent him a message
Doubt he'll reply but there we go
Doesn't matter - it'll still be nice for him too

Going into the shootout
Dutch are lucky to get the draw
Wow
Dont tell me the outcome
In gonna watch it in a bit
Sorry
Ok
No dont euro
*worry
Thought you still at Bean's
Ill only watch shootout
It's all worth watching
You all watched it
I just watched the shuffles
Ywah
Those chinese shuffs were wank ngl...
The NL keeper barely had to do anything
But fair play to China for only conceding at the end of Q4
Yeah china stuffs were poor
Wouldve expected them to do better cuz I didn't think their shuffs Vs Bel were very good either
This is true, but you can be pretty sure they never will be again
They just seemed happy to have got the silver
Which is fair
I mean it kinda looked like they just hadnt practiced them
True
NED lucky though. The pc they scored from should have been a free out, and China should have had a pc at the end
China defo should have had a corner at the end
Can't believe that was overturned
I bet they are chuffed to bits. This is a massive result. They have gone from proleague hangers on to making NED come from behind. The NED women just don't lose - they average 3 goals a game - but they had to scrap and scrap
Definitely
It's very good for the sport too
I love to have seen van Ass shaking Annan's hand. I wonder what she said to him
Having a nation like china do so well
The hockey at this Olympics has been really good <This message was edited>
Yep
I like all the aerials
Hehe
Gutted the India men though
Thought they could win it
Max v classy though
Went round all of them after the shuffles to shake hands
True

We did shuffles at the end of training yesterday.
Guess who the shuffle king is?
you?
Yea boy
Two from two
what
is your signature move
the old spin?
left right and then reverse it?
I went first too
lob?
First one, straight, slight move to the right, then meg the keeper. Stick on ball the whole time.
Second one, wide out to the left, switch back across and reverse in
sorry, wide to the right
Damn
Maybe you're the goat
I'm a little bit worried I might end up as short corner injector too
Last week we all cycling through injecting/trapping/shooting and I was the most accurate and quickest injector
Bit too quick - people had trouble trapping it
too much power from the big man
Steve Fenton spent ten minutes teaching me how to do it, and he was pretty spot on
Point your front foot where you want it go, then pull straight through
Got any good dragflick tutorial videos? 🤪
Hertzberger, I guess
yeah i'd look at hertzberger
Hmm. I reckon I could have a go.
He doesn't explicitly call it out, but he's showing how you catch the ball
So he picks it up with the end of the stick, and then as he takes the step forward, he dips lows and moves the stick out so the ball is now further up the face
Then as you pull through it's rolled down to get the pwoer
I'll have a go next week

I just had the most frustrating game of my whole fucking life

ning of the game that they have again changed the rules about receiving arials. The guys said some stuff, wasnt particularly clear, as it never is.

n from halfway between midline and 23, into the corner of our circle (exactly how they did it in the Olympics).

rking tight), runs into the corner, I follow infront.

l before he recieves it (we had run parallel to each other). No crazy interception, a good few metres between me and him. I could maybe understand a harsh umpire giving a corner, but it is very much still up to interpretation who would have received the ball first.


CKING STROKE
Apparently its a 'new rule'
Bruv
What the fuck is am i supposed to do?
he gave stroke since he thought you were making a purposeful foul in the circle
I take it he threw it into space?
Yes
So it should be 50/50 who gets the ball
if he threw into space for the attacker to receive it then i guess the forward is the clear receiver?
@447889953414
?
Okay, so if i go arialing a ball into any clear piece of the pitch, the intention is of course for my teammate to revcieve the ball
Doesnt mean it can never be intercepted
No. If it's into space, and there's nobody who's obviously nearest, then there is no clear receiver
In which case, the ball should go to the defending team
Technically, the attacking team should allow the defenders to receive it, but in practice free hit defence <This message was edited>
It is only purposeful in the sense that I intended to stop the ball. It is not purposefully breaking down play, nor is it stopping a shot on goal
I cannot think of a situation where you would give a stroke for a foul outside the D
It was inside the d
Right in the corner
corner of the circle @447889953414
the T-spot @447922463217 ?
Pretty much
OK. Did it prevent a goal?
Probably not, so pc and consider a card
God no, set defense and keeper in the goal
You didn't get a card?
No
Which is ridiculous
Makes no sense to me.
Because any stroke should get a card when it is deliberate
Almost certainly, yes
They were also blowing a fowl if you encroched within five even after the ball had been controlled
Meaning the player recieves the arial, takes a touch or two, you step in, and it is a foul <This message was edited>
They only wouldnt blow a foul if the attacker controlled the ball and then moved into you <This message was edited>
Like what?
So i cant make a tackle now, even after they control the ball
I have to let the attacker move into me, before i can tackle?
Rule is "under control and on the ground"
9.10 Players must not approach within 5 metres of an opponent receiving a falling raised ball until it has been received, controlled and is on the ground. The ball may be intercepted within 5 metres but outside of playing distance provided it is done safely.
Okay, so if i control the ball and hold it egg and spoon <This message was edited>
Now i can never be tackled
Ye, makes sense...
Like consider the level, control is not the same as on the ground
I can play a safe and reasonable pass with the without it ever touching the ground
(i was maybe within five, but 100% outside playing distance, and it was 100% safe) <This message was edited>
The initial receiver has a right to the ball. If it is not clear which player is the initial receiver, the player of the team which raised the ball must allow the opponent to receive it.
Not stated in rules, but fact - Umpire decides who the receiver is
Yes, no problem with thsi
That is reasonable
But in a 50/50 setting then how in any universe can a stroke been given
Becuase by definition it is unclear who the reciever is
Agree. From what you've said, feels like it should be play on or free hit defense
Or maybe a corner if the unpire feels like i am within playing distance or cause danger
I just dont understanding how it could possibly be a stroke
And especially how it could be a stroke and not be a card. If it is a stroke the it is a clear, deliberately intended brake down of play. That is a card
> 12.4 A penalty stroke is awarded:

defender in the circle which prevents the probable scoring of a goal
iece of equipment lying in the circle and a probable goal is prevented, a penalty stroke may be awarded.
ffence in the circle by a defender against an opponent who has possession of the ball or an opportunity to play the ball
Feels like a big stretch
This change in interpretation was communicated to you on the pitch, before the start of the game?
Why the hell hadn't the clubs had a proper briefing preseason?

It's definitely a short
Put a flick is too much
Yes, i agree
The throw is to space, but attacker is already moving there and has stopped by the time ball arrives.
If you'd taken it cleanly, you'd have carried out away from him out to your right wing, counter attack is on.
Stroke from that is wrong.
Yes i agree
If it was a stroke, then you should have got a 5 min yellow too
Exactly
Especially when you consider the extremely clear wording that the knhb have
Like i said in the vid
haven't watched all the vids
but the vid of the foul is definitely a corner
If you have come from the other side, eg from the right wing, then I'd still not go for a stroke, but would consider a green card.
only thing I can think is he must've thought deliberate breakdown
No, he said that i because intercepted in the circle so it is a stroke
okay
that seems wrong
Watching again, attacker never got 5m away from Hal.
Umpire could also have given free out.
First viewing, I thought corner. Video reply, free out.
Never a stroke.

From a umpire in our umpire commission
Umpire has played himself. He should have a good view from where he is. Attacker and you have moved laterally. Attacker never gets 5m away. He's stopped, you continue to try and mange intercept, eyes are on ball. Attacker moves toward ball, which means he's moved into your space. He should have seen you, but you would have seen him
Unfortunately, you miss the intercept, ball bounces onto attacker.
Umpire, probably keen to show he's on top of new interpretation, goes to stroke.
Other umpire should maybe have had a word - I assume they're miked up.
The more I watch, the more I go free out, although my first impression was corner
(I did get a touch on the ball)
Yeah, i mean the guy has clearly viewed it as a foul, but misread the rules and therefore gons for stroke rather then corner
I would personally be more inclined for a play on then a free out, of that was the case. Are you saying free out cuz that would mean the attacker has interfered with the defence (who have a right to the ball if there is no clear reciever)
I meant you didn't take it clean, not that you airshotted it
Yes. Because he never got more than 5 away from you, there is no clear receiver
As a team, you should have had a proper briefing on this ahead of the start of the season, though
Very true

Weird though.

You remember the lad who was refereeing a little half time game at proleague and i pointed him out as a lad from upward
Last year he played A2 here also
He left this year for uni
❤️
Turns out he umpired a game at the Olympics
What?
Ye
Stijn was his name
He umpire ireland against someone at the Olympics
Wow
With Coen
Coen is de beste
Correction
It was a practice game a think

Not bad though.
He is apparently the youngest umpire ever qualified to that level i believe



"AI"




Blocked a backhand yesterday night, but my stick got mashed



Used some fibreglass putty, to do this cheeky repair job <This message was edited>




Now i am working on a full fibreglass layup repair on this old stick that had been sitting around the club for a while





Got the first few layers of fibreglass down, now i need to wait for it to cure, then i will reshape the stick and apply a layer of fibreglass putty over the top
(and yes this dita is a C100 X bow)
That's actually sick
Lemme know how it is
Will do
Fiberglass ting and then paint job?
Maybe
We will see about the paint, might just leave it so you can see the patch
How easy would it be to restore the bottom bit of the head
You know how it gets a bit scraped off
Fairly
I actually kinda did that also on the FLX



That's cool
I dont have a before photo, but like the toe had chipped off
Such a nice stick as well btw
Lx24 compo 1?
Nothing major, more cosmetic fix then anything
Or compo 2?
Ye
Compo1
One of the best sticks ever imo
Real

cuz if you're not confident I can get one of these
which isn't a 3d bow unfortunately but the xbow isn't too bad
I think it would be a fairly easy task
Never done it before though, but I dont see why it is not possible
https://www.gingerhal.co.uk/fixing-a-medium-sized-crack-chip-in-a-hockey-stick/
The X-bow is (effectively) the same bow as the LX and the velocity
have you used the c100?
or not yet cuz it's too fucked?
Too fucked
Dont wanna mess it up any more
once you've done it lemme know how you get on
where did you get it from>?
Sure
The FLX feels great, not different from how it did before
And the patch seeks to hold up fine
how does the flx compare to my dita
?
How do you mean
in terms of softness
have you used my blue one
Ye
Umm im not sure
not the one I've not used, that one is a bit stiffer
It defo isnt the softest stick around
the flx
maybe I can find a compo 2
Ye
Ye, the compo 2 still hits like a train
wait you have a compo 2??
Ye
The old green one
ohhhh
It was the first LX i had
you able to bring that back if poss

basically brand new
shall I cop
wys
I would heavy consider copping
My compo2 is peng
Used it most of last season
Soft touch, but rams the balll
Compo 1 is a bit stiffer, not so soft, but pushing the ball has a little bit more pace
Which compo 2 you have?

The season before I think that is
Yeah, but i have two of those blue ones in compo 1
Ah
And my FLX
Do you have eBay account?
Ye
Can you cop that one for me?
Get it delivered to Northlands
I'm gonna put my ritual up on eBay
Hopefully get 180 or something for it
Tough scene
You really dont rock with it?
No
Too stiff
You tried the kromaskin?
My Dita is way better
Little bit too stiff
Fair
But quite nice
Also fair
I mean, if your gonna sell your stick, you may aswell just make an ebay account
Takes like 2 mins
https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/155691316679
Look at this
Damn
Thats quite crazy
Nerds

Look at this



I dont rock with specialist
Basically brand new specialist for 40 quid
I know
But still
I meam, i have got one
Is that 70 euros each?
Or together
The description says the sticks are between 10 and 70 euros
It's a shame they're all midbows
The first three are not

What!?
100 euros per stick







All brand new ditas wow
Basically any dita stick
Do they have any of the 3D sticks in lower carbon?
I literally can't get them here
In a different post
Same guy
He has c70 3d x bow in 37.5
For 70 euros. Also a regular X bow, 36.5 for 70 <This message was edited>


It is worth noting, I do still have both a specialist 75 and a C60 3D bow that are both in good condition
Isn't the c60 really heavy?
Not sure tbh
Or is that your other c60
I think that is the other one
C60 is the white one?
But i cant remember
Ye
Can you bring it back next time?

Just seen the lad who umpired with Coen on that international friendly
Yea?
He is umpiring the highest league of boys under 16s and under 18s on Saturdays
And on sundays does mens 2nd class, 3rd class and womens 1st class and overgangsklasse
I assume not all of those on one weekend
😂
No, I guess not
He said it was super fun to unpire with Coen
Yea, I bet it was great
Got my Khalsa top

Thats dead tbf

Enter a team so your kids can play, then sack off
I bet it's the fucking parents wimping out
2nd game is Aber uni, and that's fair enough. They haven't even started term yet, and they got in touch as soon as the fixtures came out

This looks like a lovely sauce, but at the same time old Marco looks like an absolute psycho
✅ whispering delivery
✅ too long without blinking
✅ wearing a white t-shirt while making tomato sauce
✅ chef's hat while in his own kitchen
✅ absolutely battering that sauce through a sieve
Anyway, give it a look and, if you've got time on your hands make a tomato sauce that takes at least two hours!
his knife skills are unbelievable
I've already said it - psycho!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAOMGwRjQRc
Chopping the onions while staring down the camera. Classic nut job behaviour
it's insane how thin the slices are
In truth, while Marco still keeps his knives as sharp as a razor, he's slowed down with age rather
Ramsey trained under White. That's were he got a lot of his naughty kitchen behaviours
But also probably some of his insane knife skills too
ok, he's still doing it

Yes
Okay 😂
Bro i just went into out locked room of all our extra keeper kit.

 or 20 thousand worth of kit in there
And that is only our extra kit. Not the stuff that is in use


I think yes, you can sit in the middle but I'm unsure of the details.
With your rs232 to usb, how have you tried to read it?
Also, it's laptop windows or Linux?
It's probably 9600 baud. That's normal for rs232 (a protocol so old, it was old when I was your age)
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Your-Cable-Store-Splitter-DB9/dp/B002IA3B06
If you get something like this, you can run the cable into your machine and the tester's computer without have to worry about writing things back out at your end
Which will make the whole business much easier

Ahhhh
Thats groosssss

Yea, don't think he'll be training on Tuesday
Today I must've done about 15 successful dribbles
Didn't lose the ball once
Only 15?
Pussy shit
Had one where I got the ball at the halfway line, beat two guys at the half and then ran it into the circle, beat three guys at the top of the circle to take it to the p spot and rolled towards the bottom corner and our own player fucked up trying to push it in
Guy who got called up from the 2s
Typical 😂

Whats wrong with it? The writing experience on my surface is also not the best. I get wiggly diagonal lines. Even when i manually use a ruler. It makes the whole writing experience not great.

sons i now only write on my android tablet and display tablet
(this is a known and unfixable bug on my surface pro model)
no I bought a new android tablet
Oh, which one?
A redmi pad pro 5
it's really nice but it's like the pen doesn't register always where I want to start a stroke
You've only had it a couple of weeks right? I suspect if you stick with it, you'll adjust to it without even realising
Using OneNote?
Using the redmi smart pen?
yes

might be that my pen was lacking in charge
Oh? Is it doing better now then?

What a legend
Lost today 😑
However, i got to try one of the tester fields
The none water fields
We didnt play the game on it, but we warmed up on it
It was wierd
The ball felt quick, but unferfoot it was quite hard, and almost a little slippy
Once your foot is planted you are okay, but the carpet blades are very small and curved (think the loops on velcro), meaning i think you foot could slip put
*out
And id be worried about how it felt in the rain
Bit the blades were literally little loops, not actual blades
And they liked to move in linear ways, left right, forward and back. So when you walked at a diagonal along the field, it felt a bit strange
At least Spandersbosch did too. Some interesting results today.
True
Watching Solihull 1st team play against some random dutch teM
They panned them
Ryan bennett is obviously in the team. He has unreal skill, so physically strong on the ball
Solihull panned them?
But my god, i have never seen someone with a worse attitude

Apparently he is at harbourne, playing 2s
Classic youth player!
He's played one 1s game
We see this a lot in Welsh hockey more than in England, because you can race through to NAGs pretty quickly
Then these kids show up in adult hockey and take a battering 😉
Well, hes a good enough player that he wouldnt take a battering
But his decisions are so questionable sometimes
Also Caspar is out in Malaysia playing england U21

Oh, he won't. Sultan Azlan Shah died in 2014.

When is the last game before Christmas?
Is it December 14?
The 7th.
Although I think we've got a postponed game on the 14th
Why?
Are you available?
He's shit
Every time I've played him he's done nothing
THE BEAN HAS SPOKEN
He's playing in mids 2 and there's no hope of getting to national League unless he improves big time

Do you want me to put a word in with Graham for you @447922463217 ?

Absolutely not. I am not in the business of steering a half sunk ship
Probably doesn't pay as well your gig at Upward 🤣
Real
Its a 'you do it for the passion' kind of job 😂
All the coaches kit you can carry though
Well, i have 2000 kids and adults leaving their kit at the clubhouse on a weekly basis at the moment 😉
2000?
Fuck me sideways
I think it is more like 1500
But still
Excuse me, the website says 'more than 1300'
Arnhem is about the same size as Warwick, in terms of population
But if we include travelers from other clubs who also leave stuff...
Yeah, and it has 3 hockey clubs
And your club has more playing members than probably all the clubs in Birmingham
Although admittedly the other two clubs only have a few hundred members each i would guess
HCM has slighty over 900 members
These are clubs in Arnhem? Or do you mean Nijmegen and Velp?
AHC has 650 members
HCM is on the other side of Arnhem
AHC is on velp (although is called arnhem hockey club)
If I included Nijmegen then Upward would look tiny
So in arnhem hockey clubs there are just under 3000 hockey club members
Right. And there is a club in Velp too , right?
AHC
Ah, right
Nijmegen hockey club (one of many clubs in Nijmegen) has over 1700 members
Union (also in Nijmegen) has over 1200
Apeliotes (Nijmegen student club) has 350
QZ (another club in Nijmegen) has 500
Okay so with approx. 3000 hockey club members in arnhem, and 165,000 people that means that 1.8% of people are members at a hockey club
(very roughly)
Assuming 1.8% of people in bham were members of a hockey club then bham would have well over 20,000 hockey club members 😂
20,000 people equates to 1/6th of all hckey playes in England
If 1.8% of Fishguard were hockey players we'd have over 50!
never mind all the people from Haverfordwest and St Davids!
If 1.8% of the UK played hockey then that would be 1.2 million people
According to Wikipedia 350,000 people play hockey on NL
That is 3 times as many as play hockey in england
From a population of 20 million?
?
18 mill
Which equates to just under 2% of the population
(1.94%)

I told you two weeks ago 😂
tbf I was distracted by Arsement
I knew, but it's just come up again in an FIH email
One month to go to new ProLeague btw, and Hockey India League is back
and FIH have decided to cancel the deal with watch.hockey so no clue if we'll be able to actually watch any of it 🙄
You can watch on hockey.nl
Maybe I'll have to vpn it
Wut
Wtf will watch.hockey have on it then
Nothing it's closing down and FIH will have a new streaming platform "in the next few months"
Proleague starts in 4 weeks
I need some new joycons for the Switch
and the Nintendo ones are super expensive
Any knowledge on alternatives?
Or are they all assembled by the same children in Shen Zhen anyway?
Cex?
Looks like official only and still v pricey
Considering how bad the stick drift is on those things I wouldn't buy one second hand anyway
I assume you need them to play in handheld mode?
Or do you play it docked?
Handheld
Hmmm...
I have heard that gulikit make hall effect joystick replacement modules
(i think)
So if you wanna get techy you can do that to fix any stick drift
Alright, I'll give those a spin
Your gonna try the joystick module replacement?
Yea,
Sick dude 😎
Maybe I'll do the power socket replacement in your Mumster's laptop at the same time
Been meaning to do that since about February
https://www.ifixit.com/en-ca/products/nintendo-switch-joy-con-switch-lite-gulikit-hall-effect-joystick
Tbf, ifixit seem to say it is fairly straightforward



One of our boys split his eyebrow today
Ouch. How did he manage that?
Stick to the head I think
Nasty
Yeah quite a lot of bleeding
But he bandaged up and played the eest of the game
This happened in the first half
Hero
Think he went to a and e afterwards


Attempt number 2 to fix this stick
We will see how it fairs when i give it a go this week

Is that a guy or a gal in that pic do you recon?
It kinda looks like a guy with long hair

Is he trying tap you up again 🙄
I think it's meant to be a dude doing a plank to get shredded but it looks like a pov of a twink getting pleasured <This message was edited>
No, he aint messaged me, snap just be telling me he joined twice
Down 2-0 at half time
Get back to 2-2 after a storming half
Last minute, we attack, ball goes basline to top D to back post to P spot and then is put in
At the same time, the umpire blows time
Goal disallowed cuz it was after time
By milliseconds <This message was edited>
Oof
That's rough
Unreal goal aswell
Do you have a third ump, or umpire on field?
No, only two umps
I am talking one touch passes through the circle too

What was his special subject
*her
On mastermind? Dont know
It was The West Wing
Either of you guys think you could get hold of a 38.5 or 39.5 stick?
Ritual make sticks that big
I'm hoping to get hold of something for low to no price.
Sam comes along to teaching every week, but, frankly, it's unlikely to play any time soon
He is a larger gentleman, and consequently not super mobile.
I think he might have a slightly easier time with a longer stick
38.5 is somewhat common
39.5 would be tougher
I'd be grateful if you could ask around
Best bet is eBay if you want something cheap
I agree
Can do, but id be surprised

You're a bum

Beanus had dark matter over 4 years ago and you still don't
Not good looks
Can't wait to have dark matter bo6 before you have it in CW
No, because I actually enjoy playing video games...

Tempting...
Last Thursday played a practice game against the number 6 in overgangsklasse. Drew 2-2
Yesterday played a practice game against number 4 in overgangsklasse, drew 2-2 again
For a part of the game yesterday i was marking this big forward, large and slow. So all id do is literally stand in front of his path and block him from moving, cuz he wasnt trying to run around me and i couldnt run around him
In the third quarter, he turns to me very frustrated and just goes 'come on man, can you give me a bit of space? You are always so close.'
Like bruh 😂
Get good

Oi oi

How much for those johns
Both on bid, with no bid yet. So dont know
I bid €23 on this one though. No reply yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12QuurNbhP4
"Hi, it is 175 euros new, so I was actually thinking of a slightly higher amount"
Hmmm...
Might offer him 35
But i think he might want something more like 80

So today a lot of games were cancelled because of the snow and temperature.

some of the big clubs HAVE FUCKING UNDERFIELD HEATING. To warm the field and get rid of the snow and ice.
nobody else think this is insane?
Dutch hockey innit 🤷🏽‍♂️

Lads, GB Hockey have done something sensible
Channel 4 are going to be showing the Pro League!
Wow!
That is sensible
Not following the tour de france then

How am I only the second viewer?
Cuz it aint tik tok...
I think it might only be the England games they're showing, but still better than a kick in the pants
Oh L

Nice collection of english banners at a completely random hockey club in the north of NL
Ladykillers?
Maybe I should bring F&G out to Arnhem?
You should
I would hang it somewhere
Play your H9s or you JO10s or something
9 a side in JO10 now, so might be reasonable
They probably beat us 😂
Actually sorry, i think six a side in U10 and 9 a side in U12 and then 11 a side in U14
That might be fun - three way tournament with your lowest mens team and one of the junior sides.

Yessir
Our cup game was cancelled last week, rescheduled to today
We drove 1 hour, played 1 quarter and then the game was called off
😑
Why?
Field froze
Too dangerous
Unlucky
So you'll have to go again next week?
No, i think we wait till after chrimbo. But the next round is first week march (as is the beginning of the second half of the season).

have to play it in februari
Our opposition have sacked off for tomorrow 😢
5 have been "called up for the firsts" and wanted to reschedule but we said no
They've lost 5 on the trot including to a dev side. If we rescheduled we'd 100% be playing the 1s
Tough game for you tomorrow @447757499873
No mental bro
1-1
They scored with 4 to go
We scored with 1 to go
Well recovered. Definitely a point won for you
Very tough game
I was just running the whole time
And not feeling 100% still
Yea, I know what that's like 😔
Well done though.
Won our indoor tournament today with the kids!
After a single training
Easy
Success Jongers!
Won 4, drew 1
*Gefeliciteerd jongens
Excuse me

success means good luck

you coach zaalhockey too jonger?
Ye boi
I know the rules less then the boys, and I have only ever played a single practice game myself
But clearly the goat coach
tell them your brother played NL indoor for many seasons so you learnt it from him
And partly true 😉

I have never played indoor with you 😂
Sexxy
But maybe I imparted the knowledge
Yup.. 😂
I just read some info online on the train here about the formation
Dice?
No House
And it cooked everyone
Noone could hack us having the two in midfield
Everyone else played dice
Because there is just always an easy pass off the bords to a right or left mid
And then you get such easy 3v2s because our two mids and one forward vs there two defenders

Whatch this video about a new NAS software that is in Beta, it is super cool
Extremely user friendly, and not a subscription
https://youtu.be/kiXSswB45kY?si=Ssg0FscN1xHKrhgy
And on of the coolest things that will be implemented is 'buddy backup'.

ansfer of files between two HexOS systems. But it also allows you to backup your data to another persons system. This means that you can create an off site backup of your data extremely easily. Which of course is amazing in the case of catastrophic failure like a fire.
Since it is in beta still, not all the features are complete. But for black friday it is only $99, for a liftime license.

ventually to the normal price of $299, for a liftime license

I'm just going to draw your attention to three things
ade a Donut Squad book"
ay next year, and is available to pre-order now"
OT ALL! Not only will there be a regular edition, available from all the regular places, but Waterstones are going to have an EXCLUSIVE LIMITED EDITION: …with a sheet of Donut Squad STICKERS in!"
Neill says "It is genuinely absurd how excited I, a middle-aged man, am about this" and let's just say he's not the only one
it's a well known fact
middle aged men love donuts
and also stickers of donuts

ffs
For reasons, I've just had a look at the Telford Steam Railway. You remember they used to steam up the track a bit to a closed tunnel, then steam forward over the points and everyone was amazed we were in a different place?
They've restored the tunnel!
Now they go right through to the other side
very cool!
https://www.telfordsteamrailway.co.uk/steamingtoironbridge.html
They want to extend the other way as far as Ironbridge!

Just been talking to my colleague James, and turns out he used to play national league with Loughborough Students
"It was a bigger deal playing for Loughborough than it was for Scotland back then"
He lives in Hong Kong now, where there are exactly three astros
There's some kind of weird semi-pro league which is sort of HIL adjacent, so they have these games with a bunch of HK amateurs and some amazing Indian international tearing up the place.
Thats crazy 😂
Yeah I know a guy who played in HK for a bit
Is that James the guy who's email you gave me?
No, that's a different James
Although I know yet another James at Symmetry who also plays hockey

Aww diddums
Hockey cancelled tomorrow because of danger of death 😮
Fuck outta hear
That was the reason they gave?
Your not playing on the side of a cliff

Insane backhand goal
Everything in Wales has been cancelled and people have been told not to leave their homes
As well as some stuff in England
Our game is still on but it sounds like there is a possibility it gets called off if they feel it'd be dangerous to play
Yea, that's what I thought might be happening when your Mumster asked me if you were playing
I guess also if it's too windy such that it makes it difficult to officiate for example
Like for example you can't look directly into the wind so if a ball came towards you you might not be able to see it
We'll see
Also raining non stop so dunno whether there is a chance the pitch could flood
And gusts up to 60mph

NED - GER men, live at 1pm
Hal, you might need a vpn, or it might be on hockey.nl
This message was deleted
This message was deleted
I can watch on a dutch sports website, but I wont be able to cuz I have indoor to coach
Have to watch later then
I don't know if I can
I don't know if they store the videos somewhere?
I was looking but cannot see anything
If you vpn to the FIH site, I think it'll be there until the have tomorrow.
It's on YouTube, but unlisted so if you don't have the link you cant find it
On youtube it says it is not available in my location'
Yea, because it's on hockey.nl, but if you vpn to the UK, you'll be good
I dunno, I cannot seem to find anywhere where the livestream is saved/archived
just gonna leave the live stream on my computer and record it
So I can watch it later
because of the way FIH embeds the YT live stream into a single web page. So every live stream will be on a single FIH website URL. I don't think it would be too difficult to write a script which auto-recorded the live stream from that web page. You could either get it to regularly check if the embedded video had begun, or just give the script the schedule and only run at that time.

interesting

the embedded webplayer on the FIH website doesn't list NL as not an available country. But YT does
Not sure if it is going to play then or not
The geoblock for each game is different, depending on who's playing. Because the NED games are shown on hockey.nl this game in blocked for Netherlands. The previous game, Eng - Chn was blocked here because it was on Channel 4
Yes, and it lists it different to follow that on the FIH website
Such a professional setup 🙄

this is in the source code. You can see that UK and Belgium are listed as exceptions
because it is eng vs bel
but NL is not listed for the mens
love it when the live stream starts on time...
Here we go
Stockey!
I had to leave already
But i am recording it on the dutch broadcaster

"Germany, trying to be efficient" 🙄
hero
watching the game now
"vrije slag voor oranje"
(free hit for Orange)
he says while they are in white and blue 😂
"Daar is hij, de duitse-argentine"
I think he means nazi...
I don't know if it is just because they are both really tall, but joep de mol and tim idoine look so similar when they play
ooooh, joep de mol gets cooked on the small first touch life, and then just completely decks the guy 😂 surprised no card
Yea, I was too. He absolutely battered him
Dan Strange saying how clever the striker was to draw the foul, and I'm think no, he was getting flattened all ways up
ye no, jeop has legit just ran into him and pushed him over
who is the male umpire
Can't remember, but he's British
he is an English guy with a proper city asccent
Jeroen Delmee is the most dutch man
Bro walked off the half time interview depressed as hell
And the german coach just goes "we were quite successful in the opponent half. We got some PCs and good efficiency of course@
I mean rightly. Germany hardly got out of their 23 and they're 2 up after q2
Yeah, but NL cant seem to get anything on goal
NL are pressing unbelievably high aswell. Literally the whole first half trying to split the backs
Jip jansen is so massive wtf
umpire: "you've had your say now, enuff. No, you've had your say now, enuff" 😂😂
hahahah
the English ump:
to the other umpire, while play is just going on on the field

mplaining about everything... First time I gave them the free hit, so I don't know why he is complaining."
10 mins later, the English ump again (who is standing in the NL half, and the german RB has just launched an aerial across the field and out of bounds):
ddle a bit more, if I am just gonna be sat here the whole time. Make it a bit easier for you"
NED BEL today
Starting now
Already on it
Back in Oranje today, so should play better 👍
Classic answer to "what's the game plan?"
Stockey!
Wut!
The Belgians are so good in the D
True
NL are looking a bit more alive today
The Bel goal was such a clean goal
Oh yea. He set himself for the strike so quickly
Bel are so good at holding the midfield control
With NL pressing so high there is just so much soace
*space
I see we're largely ignoring "let the ball so the work" today 😂
😂
Just wack some zip ties on the net 😂
Cheekt quarter time fix

You know your legit  when you are a 4 time hockey olympian and are sponsored by a major bicycle manufacturer 😂
Classic belgian
you ever used a Thurso @447922463217 ?
No
Don't know anyone who uses one
cuz they 50% XLB on their website
could be bussin
I wanna try a new malik
They have a LX24/Velocity shaped stick which looks nice
Havnt used a malik in years tho
They are kinda hard to find
And i dont know anyone who uses one

https://www.total-hockey.nl/products/lb-1-2023
This is a hell of a game
Real
I mean both coaches will be pretty furious, whatever the result, but it's great watching
Literally neither team can get a grip in defence
Insane!
They're going to have to put the Dutch goal back on the line after that drag
And then the counter
Such a good counter
Dutch are better than yesterday, but lucky to be level really
And now geez who scored is on the bench, classic 😂
Hmm... Yes a lot of mistakes the Bel could have scored from
But Belgium arent great in their own half
Ooohhj
Clinical
Bel didnt even touch the ball

Any guesses?
Snoop, obvs
Yup 😂

Good choice of ends from Brinkman. Bel got the sun in the face now
What a pass!
Rookie green there
How the hell have NL not scored there
Ooh, i take that back i guess 😂
Def gives him a shive, but did it make a diff?
Oh, yes
Dan Bairstow has some hella eyebrows
No, i dont think so
I think it is not obstruction
I'd have said no. There's deliberate contact, but I didn't think it mattered, so play on
Exactly, the bel defender was even attempting to play the ball
He was just trying to get in the way
So the NL guy didnt stop him from doing anything different
12 player yellow. What a cock up
No shot
Fucking rookies
Wtf
Jesus
"youve gone for referal, thats it now!" 😂
I love the way literally no one likes bullies
To the point where i dont think i have ever seen a bully actually taken the way it is intended
No matter the level, the players just wont do it 😂
Chrimbo music hitting hard
Chuffs @447757499873
Not great from the bel keep on his first. Tried to rugby tackle de mol
Not a great game from brinkman today
That last shuffle was naughty
He did exactly the same as he did last week
Also against bel 😂
Ger Bel today
At work, so we'll see how much i can watch
Me too 😂
"inside the 25"
Old skool umpiring
Are you watching Hal?
Belgium doing 5 one-touch passes ending with a shot on target
No, cuz there is no where for me to watch it...
It is not broadcast here live and the YT stream wont play it in NL
huh - even though it's ned-bel
Have you not got my VPN details?
Ye
Wait wut?
I men bel-ger
No its ger bel
Ye

Oh apparently i can watch it now
Earlier it said i could not
Empty in the stadium there
Absolutely dead
In fact i look at the website and the tickets were free
Mad
I almost asked gor the day off work
But also a wet Monday
But i am already taking friday off
oh yea
And i would have gone on the weekend but i had indoor both days
The tickets were less then 15 euro
On the day
I guess they make their money by pumping up the meatball prices
I think it will be largely from sponsors
Early referal
Jesus bel are playing well today
Also the irish ump lady is tiny 😂
https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0025vq6?partner=uk.co.bbc&origin=share-mobile

Oh actually it got there in the end, possibly just slow on my end

ah okay
Jason is doing something or other
Power hitting 90p a unit at 5pm tomorrow 😢
Get on the treadmill bro, start selling that shit back
#treadmillgenerator
ArgEng over night.
Starts at midnight, so going to watch in the morning hopefully.
ARG Ger women rn and it's the commentary team who can't call a video review - Charlie Brougham and Simon Mason!
Lemme get onit
Guess what.
They have just not called a video review
Typical
This field looks huge
Different angle - camera's much higher up than at the Wagener
Also loads of extra space on the outside of the sidlines and backline
2m of field outside the edge is the standard requirement
Ha ha, you are funny
This has about 5 on the sides and more on the back
This is listed in the rules

I know, but it's meant to be two meters without 5 a side goals, nets, bins, etc, etc
Ye true 😂
Maria grananto is an animal
She is everywhere
Yea, she's great
Great first goal
Propper indoor hockey that
Granato didn't look like a typical Argentina player either. Think of Aymar, Rebecchi, Habif, they're all tall and lean and blond. Granato's dark haired, short, and looks like she could punch your face off
Tbf to the commentators, i can see why they thought it was a foot
Real, like a frate train
(In the most non objectifying way)
Very scrappy game this. With Argentina playing this ultra aggressive press, similar to NL.

seem to handle the heat either
They've had more ball but keep giving it away
Simon complaining there was no advantage so shouldn't have played on, when part of the reason it wasn't great is because half the Argentinians were appealing <This message was edited>
Umpire decides not players, Simon
"thats a really good technical tackle" , umps blow for argentina, cuz defender has just clattered Granato as she is controlling the ball in the air, "whaat! How is that for Argentina?!" 😂
Now saying the opposite for Germany - they had the advantage but just did it poorly according to Simon
Hmm.
Don't like the Germans, Simon?
I'm off to bed. Will have to watch rest in meeting
Morning
Maybe also meeting
I mean he is cooking both the keepers rn
And the ball tempo from both teams
This game did not go how it should have gone
"I interpret that slightly differently" - classic Simon Mason
He spent that whole game trashing the keepers, trashing the germans and trashing the umps 😂
Dude was legit on a mission
Generally wrongly
you wouldn't expect anything else at this point
5 mind into the men's game and they blow another one
Tbf, i agreed with them. And sam ward clattered that guy. Semi surprised he isnt carded for that
Eng in Mizuno kit 😖
Gross
Liam sandford looks so old
Eng looking quite good tbf
Very fast on the ball
They keep forgetting the ump has more angles than we're seeing
Bit thinning on top. That headband isn't for keeping the hair out of eyes, is it?
You know that red phone at Semcorp you told us about @447757499873?
I think tomorrow's the day.
Tariffs hitting £1/kWh tomorrow tea time
Zach wallace is fucking etherial

Yes, I thought at the time you'd enjoy that
Eng Ire late tonight. Going to be a long match for the Irish
Gonna watch it tomoz
Yea, same
Wow
He did the bean drag
and then through the geez's beans
(benen in dutch is legs)
"She has got a reach. She's a long limbed athlete"
rried away over the Dutch women
Since 2018, the Dutch women have played 97 games
wn 9
only lost 1 shoot out
I think that's basically because they're amazing
Simon making up rules again
England in green, Ireland in white. V confusing
The FIH live stream page now shows the next two games
So i cannot find the Eng v Ire one
@447889953414 do you have the link to the livestream on youtube?
It is unlisted, so i cannot search for it without the direct link
I do, but up in the office. It's l'll ping over in a bit
Alternatively, if you can get the Channel 4 Sport, you tube channel
It's on there
I cannot see it on there
https://youtu.be/sFPEtYbJz8E?si=hhyXylHbcPhqeOE1
Does this work?
No, i cannot watch it cuz im not in uk
Try this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4eovwofovk
Yeah, thanks

This is new
what does it mean?
why are they looking into arabica?
Presumably they are already using it, and this is a compliance thing.
They probably want to make sure there aren't contributors from, for example, nations subject to US sanctions
what is arabica?
is it your ting?
It is
https://github.com/jezhiggins/arabica
It's older than you are
that's goated
I mean, it's probably not on the ISS or anything
could be though
and I think you'd be well within your right to claim it is
Thats fucking fire
100% agree
I mean what else do nasa do?
exactly
Its either being used on the ISS or in a bloody rocket....

Crazy
Just in the second quarter of this game now. Ireland look really good
Calnan has been ass both of these games
https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxoPzwMg7j4Iv-OkXeNzskFnCefZ0dpQhr?si=xhHXWxatOU5ekeIk
England are trying to force every single ball
Yea, they were not good on the game
The amount of 100% goal chances that just didnt come off is ridiculous
https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxsO4bQeTAe3S4YHiOjNrp50Bw8Y1IkbwJ?si=NFXJGymej-3wrJ1V
Great pass,but great goalkeeping
Ireland goal keepers were unreal
They have to be!
Even if one of them looked like he was a competitive pie eater
Wow, two identical goals in 55 seconds
Yep

Thanks!
Ireland are playing some good hockey. I don't what NZ are thinking giving up their proleague spot

Arg Eng on Channel 4 Sport YouTube channel now
Will watch this afternoon /evening
Watching eng arg now
Great first 2 mins for sam on the corners 😂
Hockey's own spud faced nipper strikes again
So what did you reckon? Best game so far, much better than against Ireland, but went to pieces for most of Q3 before getting it back together
You should ask Chris if Solihull will give him 3 years off, so he can coach GB they the next Olympics
They have a good team to be fair
He would never 😂
I know, but he's definitely qualified to

Will watch it in a bit
I saw the current score line tho
That is insane
Only just started watching
Brace yourself
Watched a bit of NED women last night. They never seem to go through a rebuilding period like other teams. The player pipeline just never stops. Drop Welten, probably best player on the world? No worries, here's a new player who drops straight in.
Crazy, i havnt watched that game yet, might do tonight
This lad Bhuhi is pretty handy
Came from barford
Went to Loughborough
Standard
You have the YT link to that game
?
I was watch last night and it was working, but seems blocked now and haven't been able to unblock
No, sorry. Tried on computer but they've already updated link to tonight's arg NED women
Q1 Eng look great, Ireland maybe starting to suffer from the schedule
Sam Ward is a hell of a striker, and then you remember he's basically blind in one eye...
Either of you played against him?
I think I have yeah
I think that might be Reggie's brother from my team
He used to be at barford, then lboro
Then obviously there's Liam Sanford
And I've also played with Sam hooper
He's got an older brother Yuvraj who's been in the GB set up too as a gk
Think it's just those three in the current team I've played with/against
Played against him too
I did short corner postman against Sam hooper lol
And he's scoring PCs for England
As in, in training
Just slinging them over and over at me
Younger
Yuvi is the same age as me
I have played both with and against yuvi
And he was the barford 1s keeper from the age of 16
Oh, that lad
Does this make sam ward the best flicker in the world?
Buhi's goal off the ingercept just should not happen at this level of hockey
Alright, actual question:

ding on the edge of my own circle. I have large feet. My heels are on the circle line, my toes are outside the circle.

s.

Is it a corner?
Yes
On the line is in
If it hits the foot on the line.
If you're other foot is forward and clear off the line, if it hits that one, then no
Yes, but the ball was not going in the circle.
So how do you destinguish between one foot and another foot?
Doesn't matter
Because in hitting my toes, which where outside the line, then it is hitting a part of my body outside the circle
We agree that any part of the ball across the line is in, right?
Yes
OK, and if the ball strikes your foot, that's a foul
(assume attacker is disadvantaged, etc etc)
A foot on the line is in the D
Therefore, if the ball strikes a foot which is on the line, the ball is striking a foot in the D, hence pc
That's just science
Okay
Then how do we differentiate between body parts?
Becuase if i have one foot in the circle, and one foot out. And the ball hit my foot outside the circle. Then that is a normal foul, not a pc
But where is the dividing line between the two legs?
And why are the two legs counted as seperate bodies in this instance?
Yes
(possible answer:
 based on immediate vertical proximity. Eg. Image the circle line extends infinitely upwards into the sky. Anything outside the wall is outside the circle, and inside the wall is inside the circle.)
We're concerned with feet, because if it strikes you on the leg it's a dfo
So, for me, it's where the foot is - it's it across the plane of the line or not
And that's OK. For short corner injection, at least one foot must be in play, so there's precedent in the rules
Yes, exactly
Your willy
And for women?
The lady-willy
But this doesnt follow your explanation of my initial foot question
Yes it does
No,
Becuaee from what i said you slice the body in two, that could also mean slicing a foot in half
And outside is out, and inside is in
No, like I said, I'm treating each foot separately, because if the ball hits from the knee up, it's a defence free hit, rather than attacker, so doesn't matter <This message was edited>
Hmmm...
Makes sense
I'm doing another umpiring course in January. I'll let you know if this comes up
Sweet, but it wont 😂
It's 3 x 2 and half hours, so it might. It's a Hoci Cymru course, not the GB L1
Over a number of days i hope?
Yea, one evening a week over three weeks
Oh fair
Have you seen Eng Ire yet?
Ye
Thing is, Ireland were that bad, but England were just non-stop all game
They could have had 12
^^
You at the airport?
Yep
There the Jipster, but Sam must be up there. He's got a lot of variation
Also, he whips the ball right at the last minute
It completely cooked the ire keepers today
And also did the argentine keep
Just did a lil survey for the office of national statistics, about my time travelling in the uk
I did one of those once

 you traveled by air into or out of the UK?"
"About a 100“
"I'm sorry, what?"
@447757499873

(will was a camp hill old boy who plays squish with gab)
Arg Ire this evening. If Ireland can get back up, and ARG sit back, I think Ireland can still get a result.
I've just got that level of street cred
They'll win a gane somewhere this season
I agree
Ire have looked decent despite their struggles
They have
Proper leg end @447757499873
Absolutely hilarious if you ask me
They still cant play pool 😂
Is the table still there?
I assume so
Which just makes it even funnier
Oh yea. It's taunting then
Them
Just went through passport in NL
I went to the dude, said "i have an ID card, but I lost it. I have a police report if you want proof'
He replied "no, its okay, i believe you"
Like wut?
Only someone who's had that happened would know that's how it works
If you were going to try and bluff it, you wouldn't offer alternative proof - you'd bluff it
And to add to the list of things that are elite about NL:

 fleet of bikes (classic dutch bikes, single speed with coaster brakes) that you can ride around the factory floor. So you can get from one side to the other quicker.

police also have both bikes and segues that they ride around on. The bikes that they use are the standard issue po-po onese. Which means they are more commuter bikes with 8 gears and flat handlebars.
11 seconds left in the quarter, NED women go from the own goal mouth end to end and score
Amazing

@447757499873 the nike hockey sticka have just been dropped
Literally today i think
Oh ffs, they are not normal hockey stick shaped
???????????

(ignore chrimbo man in the yt video window😂)
Yeah they look similar to Adidas
Or those old Grays sticks which were sort of triangular
Are you able to tell carbon percentage?
Yeah more like these
Grays still produce a stick like this actually
I think it is still branded as an AJ
They dont list carbon percentage but they make three variants of each shape, priced at £300, £215 and £150.

either a 100%, 75% and 50% or a special carbon, 90% and 75%
Aka "Really painful", "Painful", and "Not very good for hitting"
It really depends
My ritual isn't painful to use and neither is Hal's
I don't like my ritual but I certainly wouldn't describe it as painful
And my Dita is way better for hitting than my old ritual 55 despite being lower carbon
It does
Also depends on what you are used to. Recently i have been using an 8 year old adidas which is 90% carbon and stiff as a rock. Like super super stiff.

ut can be difficult to control the ball, and hitting is not the most comfortable thing bellow about 9 degrees. But you do get used to it, and it starts to feel okay after a while. And putting some tape on the end really dampens everything down
Some of us just don't hit. Problem solved 👍
fair
(I can hit fairly reliably now, but probably wouldn't do it a game except in an emergency)
to be fair, I am exactly the same. I do not think I have hit the ball in a game even once this season. But the same stiffness still is felt while slapping the ball
At least you've manged to play 😢
So close for Ireland 😔

Looks fire
I like their green kit. Propper irish
whatching the arg ire game now
great first goal
he winked at the mother fucking camera
what a g
@447757499873 get yourself a lil wink on camera

hahaha
average irish bloke
you know yesterday I posed the question of if sam ward was the best flicker in the world. I would like to formally change that to Tomas Domene.

IRE, he scored bottom left, bottom right and top left.

eal

Jesus
He absolutely whammod that sgit
Yup
One of the Morrocan guys at work always calls me Sir, and I've finally worked out why
It's because I'm not an Uncle, innit
Damn bruh, that means your either too old to be his uncle, or too young 😬

It's too formal - he knows me through work, not through family and friends

Next HIL game in about 45 minutes, but extended highlights on the stream atm
People in 150 countries watch the HIL apparently, which given how well they've publicised it probably means 5 people in Pakistan, 4 in the UK and 1 in all the other countries
Out atm, might catch the second half
Four honoured guests = four portly chaps with mustaches 👍
Some quality international stick leans 🏑
Coen shown three green cards in the first 10 minutes
Omg

An "abso-lyoot ripper" of a short corner
Toofan means storm or cyclone or something like that
This is the longest video referal ive ever seen
Took a bit hole to find the right bit of video 😂
2nd foot doesn't matter because Peillat already signalled

Only me or is the quality kinda ass?
Stream quality?
Bit in an out, but mainly OK here
I suspect they are not globally load balanced, so we are streaming from servers in India
Ye
Is it my imagination or does Coen look like he's cut down on the oliebollen?
He is looking trim
Sweet shuffle from Wallace
Yamasaki v good too
Wallace again being the goat on his second one too
Live the fakey fakey, but the change of pace was killer
Just straight improvised aswell
So how do you feel about your boy being on the same team as Peillat?

Just turned on - been measuring for sofas 🙄
Morton should have had that advantage
He did have a semi temper tantrum at the ump after 😂
Did they appoint the coaches before the auction?
Dont know
Paul Revington coaching Gonasika, and they end up with his GB keeper, Waller, Morton, etc
True, that is a bit suspiciious
Colin Batch coaching tigers, they have 4 current Australians
(also 3 older Belgians)
Coen
Looking fly
Gonasika have 5 Brits - Struan Walker and Jocob Draper too, plus Charlet and Clement from France
Ollie Payne having a mad one today
They keep penalising Bictor Charlet because he's twice the size of pretty much everyone else on the pitch, and so it's the classic big man knocking down a kid scenario
This is dumb
This umpire is being stupid
They shouldnt still have to refer it
If you make the sign, that's it
Mandeep is quality
Colin Batch has put a rocket up the Tigers arse
Colin Batch is such a grandad. Check that grey pully
Literally
Stick just went fucking flying
Umpires seen it as a massive stick foul
Fair
Payne almost had it
Ye
This is wild
Great save frome payne
Oh no...
Howard has fucked it
Jesus Christ
There have been a few times in the HIL when everyone stops playing
It is funny to watch the teams so unorganized
Stupid shit happens out of nowhere
Stream is much better today
True
Took them a while to get the audio mix in check
And they seem to do the replays at the wrong time, or not at all
But the quality is better
That is a harsh card
This umpire is on a mission
No way that push isnt a corner
Did look pretty nailed on from here

Dude
Webm is totally well supported
Wut?
I can play on Windows media player but cannot scrub through the vid at all
Also it is very choppy
Install VLC and try that
I'll see if I can convert to something else

Uploaduing an mp4 now
it#ll take a few minutes
Sweet
Thanks
any good?
Runs fine, but it is still a bit choppy. Kind of once a minute, the video becomes very choppy for about 5-10 secs. The audio remains good
that might be an artifact of the actual stream
I was in calls for some of it, so not sure how good it was
When i recorded the proleague, i just used OBS to record the window. That worked well
Oh right, fair
This is, I think, using the screen recording built into linux
I could use OBS but it would probably be the same
liek I said, I think it's down to the quality of the stream

a grizzly bear or an elephant
Obviously the elephant has size, but the bear has speed and manoeuvrability
Also razor sharp claws, as mentioned
So, bear? Unless the elephant can get a good squish in early

It's such a bullshit thing to lie about
Who hasn't played "a lot of videogames"?
Yeah but it fits into his MO well
like he's constantly trying to sound like he's some sort of alien intelligence being
he's definitely paying people to "shoot rockets into space"
he's a drug addled lunatic
so being one of the best players in the world at a video game plays into that image
he tries to make it seem like the only reason tesla exists is because of him (even though they had built electric cars before he arrived), same with spaceX etc
and this is just part of that
interestingly I saw some people saying that there's a chance that this is the thing which breaks the illusion for these young people who think he's the best thing since sliced bread
which would be hilarious
Well, yea - he's only the "founder" because he sued the guys who actually set it up, and they let him have that title in the settlement, even though the company obviously existed before he got involved

Stick weighs 540g, but tbf i thought it felt lighter then that
The stick that i have been using most of the season is 580 with a grip 😣😂
It feels heavy as hell

I got a new stick today aswell. An LX24 compo 2 from a few years back
In practically brand new condition <This message was edited>
Cuz ive spent most of the year swapping between a very old LX24 compo 1, which is super heavy and feels like it is made of metal. And a slightly newer FLX24 compo 1. But i really dont like the adidas sticks with grooves in the back, it just looks odd. The FLX is really nice, it just doesnt feel quite right, I cannot put my finger on it.

o 2 is absolutely destroyed, the face is delaminating and it is gonna brake if i go back to using it. But it was a nice stick.

nother

e still a bit stiffer then id like, so i have to wrap tape around the bottom, to soften the touch. But then that makes them head heavy and a bit cumbersome, particularly if the stick is already really heavy
is that my new dita
looks the same as the blue
as mine
It is almost the same
The decal is a different colour
And the decal is shiny. Yours arnt, right
mine are
the old ones aren't
it looks identical to mine lmao
Oh
Maybe i am thinking if the wrong thing then

It is not that light but the dexl is identical
Are you sure that photo is colour accurate?
*decal
it's the dita picture so i would hope so
Fair
No it is a darker blue
the headshape loos different though, slightly thinner toe

On which?
your picture
The lighter blue or darker blue?
than mine I mean

Oh yeahz yours are wierd

That is next to the C60
oh maybe not actually
It does look ever so slightly chunkier
Just whipped out the calipers and it is only like -1 or 2 mm are varying points

it's so odd
there's no depth of field to this picture so it's impossible to tell really where everyone is lol

where's your captain's armband?
Recovered a ball of their shot, tookit away from striker, skilled out another attacker, made the pass. 10 seconds later we're in their D

reat pseudo punchline at the end
India Spain starting now
yep, just been watching the IND-ENG women
Max kaldas' accent is so fucked
He sounds aussie with dutch with some other stuff in there 😂
he;s got more Spanish
Ye
Is there a reason all the indians stand like soldiers during their national anthem?
Like hands down at the side and stuff
"Whenever the Anthem is sung or played, the audience shall stand to attention. However, when in the course of a newsreel or documentary the Anthem is played as a part of the film, it is not expected of the audience to stand as standing is bound to interrupt the exhibition of the film and would create disorder and confusion rather than add to the dignity of the Anthem."
Maybe slightly different interpretation of stading at attention?
That is what standing to attention is
Nah nah, but like if you watch spain or any other team, they have their arns around eachother or whatever
India didnt
https://youtube.com/shorts/HsnWqL3A7rs?si=jYD2mR7p0M2kLOaJ
If the spud faced nipper scores today, he'll overtake Homeless Jacko as England's top scorer
Ye, I just heard too. Mad
bloody hell
this singing is something else
Might have to ask Graham if they've had complaints again
Boom!
Up the spud!
great corner
What a way to do it too. Absolutely whammoed it
England let Spain back into that game
This shoot out is wild
I am just on the 4th quarter
slightly behind
Soz
but been a lot of unnecessary tackles so far!
mazarello is actually different
You got the IND-GER game on?
The new GER away kit is something
says it aint started yet for me
I'm watching them announce the teama

Eng vs Spa now
Loving Liam Stanford's absolutely cock-on international stick lean

did you just see that Spanish guy try to shoot through his own legs/
?
back to goal, ball between his feet, forehand shot through his legs

That was a great finish
England are not good today
They cannot mark a man to save their life
harmanpreet is such a wizard
bro hasn't gone quicker then a walk
and just pulling out stupid skills
like bro
also, any ideas why Zach Wallace isn't playing for eng?#
No, no idea, but they've been trying out some new guys so maybe rotation?
bro, people who play international hockey are actually so good
its not normal how good these guys are
wtf

Commentary quality taken a dive now Simon's on the mic
How good would you be if you were training full time, 5 days a week?
You watching the India-Spain women, @447922463217?
Nah
Not a lot of highlights, but Spanish goal early Q4 is a banger
Simon gets a video referral  as wrong as possible. Standard
Not as good as they are tbh
Arg-Bel men at 10pm UK time tight, Arg-Aus 10pm UK tomorrow
There are two lots of proleague at the same time - Kalinga, which is good for euro-daytime viewing, and Santiago del Estero which is great if you can't sleep
I don't know, I reckon you could be
No sure ill be able to watch these tbh
No, me neither
But I think fih might have changed how they stream
Don't think it's YouTube any more
So if you start the stream, and then pause it, I think you can come back later if you don't reload the page
Might be worth a go anyway
Yeah, i saw that you couldnt find the youtube link anymore
Okay i will see
Apart from letting you watch the proleague, how's are you finding the new term?
That good, eh? 😉
So far so good
Pretty relaxed tbh
Also @447757499873 Gabbi's new Sheffield Squash jumper is made by Y1
Harry coming in with the essential details 🙄
Ye
You deleted this message
Fucking hell. If I can't type the bantz right first time...
very chill to be at home four days a week tbh. This afternoon I went to the club and played hockey for like 2 hours
quite lit
Not too strenuous yet, then?
just been revision of previous stuff atm tbh
Both teams are playing at such pace
particularly Belgium, but arg are matching it
Mad
They said its 30 degrees on pitchside
rediculous
unreal from arg
Can't believe it
gorgeous
Bel have it for what three minutes?
Then chuck it away
I know, they have such control
They will get it back I think tho, surely. But maybe arg can score another counter attack and then it will get sticky
Crazy run through 5 Belgians they're
Just with a shoulder shimmy sold them all
omg
did arg even try to man mark
wtf
Stroke from open play
How is he completely open on the back line
Naughty
off a long
rocket
Here's your boy Tom Boon <This message was edited>
easy goals for the boy
Did he teach you that Hal?
probably, I just wasn't paying attention 😂
300 goals is crazy <This message was edited>
Do you ever drop that in at Upward? <This message was edited>
what
"oh yea, I was taught to drag flick by Tom Boon"
nah, cuz I cant drag flick to save my life tbh 😂
Doesn't reflect very well on tom
😂
No meds 😢
such an L
maybe I should go on a medication fueld hockey pilgrimage to Belgium to find Tom
He might be cheaper than Jeroen
he makes elon look cheap
Belgium are so good
jesus christ
that biff?
just winning that corner
sahahahahahhhahhhhhha
I wasn't b😂ng sarcastic
*being
oh my god
The passing then to square it across the D, and it just went right through
Bel are making these passes into the circle look easy
just cutting them apart
I think just cause they are playing at such a high tempo
Argentina having to work on the break because they've not got Belgium's high speed passing
yeah. This might be one of the highest level 20 mins of hockey I have seen.
Arg aren't necessarily playing their best.
ing so well
Look how many Belgians work back
D is full before the cross comes in
I know, it is particularly important when arg are so good on the counter
this pitch it awefule
have you seen, it has ruffles and ripples in it
Cheeky Odisha advert behind the goal
I think that's just water makrks
nah, I don't think it is
when you get a low angle, you can see it
on the sidlines
I'veplayed on worse :D
real and relatable
so many people forward for belgium
Did Arg just sub 6 at once?
was it 6?
there were defo a few Belgians subbing and the same time
every arg attack is a counter of like 2 v 5
I swear both arg and belgium, in particular, are the two most jacked teams. Like everyone is so hench. More then the other teams
They have both really been flagging this quarter tho. A few unnecessary mistakes and stuff
No surprise tbh
Lovely finish and counter attack
That is mad
Boon fucked it, but the recovery was incredible
Yeah
The amount of goals here at the end shows how tired they are I think
Fr
I think the final score is a bit unrepresentative of the game
Wow
Belgium should have more goals and arg a few less
Yea
Belgium could have been up at 8 or 9
Yeah, definitely

So typical, defenders win when it is only 3v3
Always
Commentators currently trying to convince us arg didn't get diddled by bel last night...
Like bruh, what were you watching?
"just a few small errors that led to goals" 😑
Side note:

is rogue as hell. Got that little tempo switch up
A few small errors by the Belgians that lead to less goals more like
Literally. Arg cant make mistakes if they cant get the ball...
What's it like to get called up for an international and they haven't got your photo
This aussie team is giving strong U23 vibes
Real
Also that baldy needs to be careful in the sun
When did Colin Batch quit? P
Oh yeah, got some grandad in to replace him
Mark Hagar?
Used to coach NZ then GB women
Did he always have a cracking moustache, or is that an aussie cultural development thing?
Looks like Dr eggman
He is Australian, so it just grows naturally
It's in the genes


Not as good as it was in my head tbh...
He would have played against Chris at the 96 Olympics
Assuming Aus played GB. He was there anyway, captained Aus
Wiwowowo
His niece
Is Kaitlin Nobbs
The original
The first nob
The og Knonby
*knobby

Full respect for the og
I refer the honourable gentleman to the answer I have some moments ago 😂
Sheee
My bad
That was a sweet ariel
Lekker scoopy
Just so quick, no set up just threw it
Catch the aerial, step in, easy 2m pass back, fucked it
Can't believe it
That was awful defending
Why did they ask back of
Off
Yeah, what were they thinking?
It must have been a miscommunication
Simon on his bullshit again. The Australian wasn't obstructed because the Argentinian was in front of him and hold his line, and the Australian was just trying to fabricate something
Tough game this. Who do I want to lose most?
Crazy counter to blow from aus tbeir
*their
Literally
They both are making it hard for themselves.

g and copious 1v1s, like play actual hockey fellas
Run it off lad
He got whammed
He had armour on
Surprised he could just play on, didnt even have to take 2 mins rest
Still
It would give you a nice bruise even if it was on your shinpaf
Yes, and I've had them
Adam was showing off a bruise on his arm from the game on Saturday <This message was edited>
And I was like"no dimples?"
Argentina just keep missing passes
So do Aus
Wtf.
He murdered that guy
Real, i mean arg are straight shitting the bed
But still
Arg are flagging already i think
He decked the keeper there
Unless Australia up their game about 900%, Belgium are going embarrass them too
Whiplash
Surely
Keeper with a man bun under the helmet? Bold
I think arg should legitimately be the better team here
But they are not showing it
And if bel straight embarrassed them. Then i worry to think what an experienced belgium team will do to a bunch of fresh faced, nappy wearing aussies
Twice Aus left that guy open
Great passage of play from arg their. But, yeah, man marking might have helped aus...
Good call from the ref
Stroke all day
Yup
Keeper has pushed him over
Hand all over his back
Groin guard up the chuff
And done a little grapple tackdown
Aint taekwondo buddy
That is one ugly tackdown
*takedown
Leg guard hooks the knee tio
Ye
Also that stick swing the first time causes obstruction for the arg fel
Nooooooo
What
What
Wtf
Are you kidding me
Fucking americans
Wtfwtfwtdrgggwghe
Are you serious?
Does she know the rules?
That is an awful call
It aint ice hockey
Possibly one of the worst Video calls i have ever seen
Great ball across their
Arg playing better the past few minutes
Yes, much more control. But i cant help but feel like it is more that Australia have lost any sense of structure in defense
Arg need to have put one of those chances away tho imo
3 or 4 really high quality chances with no outcomes
The keeper that they just subbed off looks like a druggy
So many ugly, lazy tackles from both teams. And not being five from that arg fella is again just lazy
Great aerial and then urpight backhand their from aus
The amount of open chances to absolutely cream the ball, the arg have fluffed is ridiculous
Also, where is domine? He was a rocket on the corner when arg played eng
(pre chrimbo)
That free hit was shit.
If you're going to go quick, you've got to be at least near a stick
Ye, these long balls are not working at all
For both teams
😂😂
The lights just died
Yay
Love it
Another Soles in the meter
Wow, did you see just how bright they were on full brightness. And then they had to turn them down?
Unless it was just the camera exposure adjusting
Oh, peso
Such bad tackling
Arg are realling doing well getting everyone back on counter attacks. But then their tackle quality is awful
Just hanging the stick in
Exactly
Absolutely no patience
I'm still thinking about a tackle I did 3 weeks ago. It was so sweet
YeH?
Lad runs down on his right wing, beats defender on the 23, turns and angles into the D, clearly looking to pull ball back toward p spot.
ine, I step in to cover the line to the P spot, make a one hand reverse tackle around his feet, absolutely clean, knocking the ball back behind him
und, step across strong, carry ball away, over 23, put the pass away
It was so beautiful
Step in, take ball, leave him for dead
There should be a cars there too
Card
Ooh ooh! I have one too!

2 sundays ago) i did a spidey senses thing. @447757499873

ide the geez on the ball, and i know his teammate is behind my back, on the other side of me, looking for the 10m pass through my legs. The guy on the ball over stretches slightly on the ball, and then shovels the ball semi under his arm, and it is going through my legs (he is still running on the ball and i am channeling him, quite close to him).

ass and, in stride, reach back behind my legs (so stick in my left hand, on the left side of my body, on the weak side) and pick the ball clean. Get it under control and make a gorgeous pass 30m over to a free guy on the other sideline.

Absolutely crazy.
Aus player just coming straight across atyacker
No attempt to play ball
Got away with it because whistle went
Oh, i love that. The attacker was probably fuming aswel, no way that tackle should come off clean
Picked him like a kid in the candy store. Like an apple off a tree. Like an ice climber. Like a smooth guitarist.
Why have arg not scored yet?
I know. They have had chance after chance. And yet the aus keeper has barely had to do a thing...
Also, i dont think i have ever seen so many bodies on the ground over the course of an international hockey game
This is not normal
The arg guy has completely fucked that their, mistrap and then just hit it straight to the aus winger
That has to be a goal for aus on that attack
Wut
3v2 with good positioning
Why did he move?
He moved behind the defender
Yeah, and closer to the goalie
So. Many. Bad. Passes
Holy hell
Should have gone the other way, and called it
And omg, i might scream if i see another hand on the back or a stick wafting tackle. So crap.
Did you hear the dugout?
No?
"oh come on!"
After the mistrap, when he nearly lost it over the sideline
This is actually a bad game
Yea
Why, actually why is every defender on both teams hedging every single tackle. They are going for an interception 100% of the time, and then when they miss it, they are turning and just trying to smash the guy on the ball.
There should have been a bunch of cards early on. Get that crap under control
We should have got to bed
So true
That was rubosh
Wasnt worth watching
Welp, night night fel
Night Hal
you watching this game @447889953414 ?#
ire looking hot early
Just come out of a call
Putting it on now
Think I'll sack off work this afternoon
have you got in on yet?
Yes,
That was great
The build up, everything
yes, really good from IRL
so much control in the build up
irl are playing with so much energy
India are half asleep
the india Germany game was a slow slog aswell tho
But it is unlike Ind to play so slow, like they are today and in their last game
It feels to me a lot like it comes from Harmanpreet, he was flagging on Wednesday, and if he does again today then they might struggle
assuming irl can hold this pace, which im not convinced that they can tbh
I feel if they put more pressure on irl higher up, it'd be a different have game
Here we go
I agree
why are india so low?
Irl cannot keep up with the india stick skills, so put them under pressure and they will fumble
Yes
But look at that last minute. Irl much better vision, passing to stick
India's passing was loose
true
india are lacking focus. and Harmapreet playing piss slow passes around the back does not help
every time he gets the ball he holds up the play. no movement, no creativity and low ball pace
For the goal, they beat one defender 1on 1, and for the pc they didn't beat any, just played around
Show this to your kids
and then if you look at irl, they are all busting their ass to get back behind the ball each play
swarming the ball
see that was a much better pocket press from ind just then. Shame the ball got through, but more of a hit and hope from itl
Sukjeet did too much there
Yep, and then turned and complained instead of going for the tacklback
good press from in on the left back
*ind
although, look at how high harmanpreet is in this press. They open themselves for the long ball through and then a 3v3 high up in the field
Simon Mason unexpectedly speaking truth
Ireland have got so much out of the proleague
very tru
ofofofofofa
what a fucking goal
That was a mistake
yeah, the last defender made the wrong call
he went to follow his man to the back post
he should have gone to the ball
This message was deleted
Yea, should have closed
yep
great goal
Especially for Mandeep
You know he can whammo it
India found the gas now
must be confident
oh yeah, defo stick
and defo foot
wow, Ireland are feeling this preasure
great save from carr, almost lucky
Keeper back on his feet really quick
Sensible irl
Just slowing it dowb
yes, much better quarter for india
what an unreal pick from the ind attacker off the save of the irl keeper <This message was edited>
epic story here
Omg
unreal save
But distracted during Q3 & 4, but I think irl will be disappointed and India a bit relieved
Yep, i mean India really turned up the heat in the second half
Just catch up with ENG-NED women. Your girl Sabbie Heesh starting in goal @447922463217
She's having a good game. Forced into a couple of 1 on 1s with strikers
England looking OK for most of first half. Half way through Q3 and suddenly NL are 4 up
Aus Bel, here we go.
Some bad taches on those Australian faces
might be able to catch the second half
Aus stroke, Van Doren saves it
!
That's nuts
Can't decide if Aus had a good start or Bel had a slow one, but Belgium just all over Australia now. About 10 minutes in and they've had 5 or 6 shots on target
Got a cup game tomorrow. Any bets on whether we'll be playing Bridgend 3s or Bridgend Ringers
Aus have scored and it's all on Van Doren
14 seconds left. Classic Aus
alright, im watching now
@447757499873 I saw one of, if not the, best looking hockey stick ive ever seen today
a new osaka
HOLY FUCK
all the new Osaka sticks look insane








all the other sticks are oring and black. but these green and purple ones are crazy
one of the lads in my team just copped this. With a white grip it looks nuts
.
.
.
.
.
.
that was a stupid referal
Simon not on the rules again
It's 13.3.g Simon
Sorry, that's the rules about being behind the line and not touching the ground in the D
13.3.i is about breaking
hows he not buried that
Those are so sexy hal for sure
Goddamn
in real life it is so nuts man. the colour is so cool
it has so much depth. the colour looks like it is layers with the carbon
genuinely, the craziest shit I have ever seen
if it wasn't an Osaka stick then I might try to cop one..
great work from aus
They've won 1 game vs bottom of the league, and on - 38 goal diff. Should be easy, right?
one would hope. But Id be worried about the ringers tbf
I am surprised on that video call
Yea, rest well, Bridgend have no other games
You deleted this message
There are some wild goal differences in the league above us

the under 16s had a -80 goal difference of something crazy
in just 8 games or something
Yesus

Poor jongers 😢
Also 3 Swansea teams, which I didn't think was allowed
that was an unreal passage of play from bel
would have been a nutty goal
holy
Aus starting to look tired.
bel getting back into it. they have not looked anywhere near as good as the other day
True and true
Gave wegnez so much time at the top of the d
Let him get strong
Boon's done it
He's a wizard
the defender backed off again slightly
crazy touch
Incredible to get the deflection off the deflection
great keeping
aus has missed some sitters
This is sweet hockey
Aus are playing better then last game aswell
Yea
omg
Belgium's counter defense is not working at all
Some fruity language on the pitch
What are Belgium doing?
their defense is just straight bad
Wow
how have bel just let the aus lad stumble into the circle and shoot their?
Apart from that goal, Van Doren's having a blinder
that was an unreal save
the stick save before the corner
that was the most relaxed drag flick ever
didn't even look like he tried
That was so stupid
real
Ball want even close
yeah, I don't think it was deliberate tbf
Australia have stolen a point here
true. but at the same time they missed plenty of chances themselves
Schweet shuffle
If bel lose this
Right ml
?
Wut?
Right?
They shouldnt lose this
Shouldn't have sent Brand in
He had no plan
Now that is a classy shuff
Kina's got a plan
Doink
He has a big snooter
The aus keeper jumped like he was possessed
It's like a sail!
Hockeyroo
Night then kids
yessir
night night fels
I didn't watch the bel arg game
have you seen the score @447889953414
are you watching it
what the fuck is that score?
No, I was too tired. I'm going to try and watch today
I didn't watch, but i saw a little bit of the last 5 mins
Just watched highlights, of which there weren't many, except for the last 30 seconds
Let's see if Arg Aus can give us a better game than last time
Aus begs on Q1, but Arg picked it up in Q2.
Still want both to lose though
Arg win by a goal.
Best bit, Aus get a PC on referral with 10 seconds to go and just absolutely fuck the trap, free out
8-2 Germany-Ireland flatters Germany. They are the better team, but Ireland have really put in a shift. They play again tomorrow though 😢
Damn L
India England later on - that'll be on the C4 YouTube if you're in university today
@447922463217 have you sorted out my stick yet?
No not yet 😔
you able to sort it so that you can bring it with you at the weekend?
The thing is, it is considerably more expensive to bring on the plane, then it is to just ship it with a courier.

ing on my flight.


he post it is 20 euros
Ah okay
But, i will try to get it sorted as soon as i can. And then ill send it
I will try to do it this week
Appreciate if you can get it done moderately soon cuz I think mine is on its last legs
Jon Jon Dohman is the new coach of France 😯
And he got Joeren Hertzberger in as forwards coach 😯😯😯😯
Watching Ind-Eng and the babystealer is having a shocker
5 entirely unforced errors
At one point, he's midway between his 23  and halfway, and he turns and plays it straight back to absolutely noone and it goes out for a long
Like not a missed pass, there was literally nobody there
What the fuck
Hugh?!
Get it together
The babystealer's got a new baby, btw

I am watching the game now

normal photo

live comment on the stream
I'm at half time, ping me when you catch up
lots of sloppiness so far
im 5 mins into the second quart
see you soon :)
im at half time now
ok, one sec
Ready?
yep
Go!
silly card
omg
what a ball, what a shot
unreal save from mazarelo. to make the second save while down is nuts
He's playing out of his skin
Wow
that handling is crazy
for the corner
Naughtiness?
no, just the skill, he went through like 3 players
ohh sam ward
that so fucking soft
Oh dear
The push is naughty, but Sam is naughtier
absolutely
Card for ward
it should be
he didn't let the vid ump finish
"it's a Hollywood"
he should have been carded
100%
Video ump was going to recommend
yeah, clearly
that is an umpiring communication mistake
because the Indian crowd couldn't shut uop
Of course Simon disagrees
Wooooooooow
Does Simon actually watch the game?
😂
India feeling like it's there's to win now
yep, they have just come out with all guns blazing
That's danger, surely?
what time are you on, I think im a min or so behind
im just at the start of the pc
4:30
4:39
OK, pc given
oh, im a bit ahead of you
let me know when you get to 4:00
Reward at 4:30
Doh! Advert
and I will wait for you at 4:00
Ok
ooh, is this why I am ahead! I have youtube premium, so no ads
Fucking hell Jugraj can flick
OK 4:00
Pc at 2:33
yep
This is mad
It's like they were playing with a rubber ball
ping pong hockey
im ready on the start of the 4th
let me know when you wanna start
One sec
Ok
go!
Hot start
yes, a lot of emotions in this game
wow
they just hit a corner??
I don't know if I have ever seen a hit in a mens game
Not from a team at this level
i don't think it is a stroke, I think it is a corner
it looks like it hit his foot on the line
Yea
Restart the pc
I think it is silly that when you restart the game, it becomes a second corner
But if it was a free out, the defenders have an advantage
So you play a let
And do it over
yes, I spose that makes sense
If it had hit an Eng foot, say, them yes, free out
But for no offence but the whistle went during play, start over
A
Eng have pulled this back
yes, india have slowed down
Nice work in the corner
Love the little stick stand

We had to do something on the back suspension in the service, I think, and I asked thay
coach wont be happy
And they said no, it's just old 😂
What has Gall done?
just decked the guy

smothered him, outside the top of the circle
Mazarello is on one

Did he get up your chuff?
i genuinely think hie is one of the best goalies in hockey
he was UoN captain the year they won every game in MP
Because he was all ovet him then
he blew it
omg
Oh man
Nothing, surely
yeah no
Umpire body language is wtf
They absolutely wait for that
Wow
That was a proper game of hockey
That second Eng goal was fantastic
All the goals from open play. Don't see that often
Got to be Mazarello for Mom
Ward won't get it because the Hollywooding
Mazarello looks about 13
Did you play against him @447757499873?
He was Loughborough Students

This a friendly?
ye
Gezellig
against guys at the top of the league above us
it is good from the first minute 😉
Won't play on my phone😢
I'll try on the laptop tomorrow if I haventime
okay
Send timestamps 😂
alright, I will do my best
Note 1: the ump on the camera end of the field is the lad who umpired that pre-Olympic international friendly with Koen. He is the youngest ever CS+ level umpire in NL (not sure what the English equivalent is, but it is basically national league I think)

*Quarter 1:*
01:00 - *Goal 1*
 against me for no reason (ump said I body checked him, I didn't)
r attack by us from their corner
ner
sane spidey senses*

*Quarter 2:*
uki mistraps the ball from the off, the ball goes off the sidline and then everyone (including the umps) watch as he takes the sideline free hit even though the ball came off him so is clearly for the other team 😂*
e interplay, this is real hockey
s the intercept, sprint 50 metres back, get in front of my man, spin my stick in my hand, and then pick the cross ball (hero)
e slider from caleb
ork but I got stranded on an island, did a nice lil' shake-and-bake on geez, then made a lovely pass which Werre couldn't stop
 how you score a goal! (Goal 2)*
s 2 interceptions and a tackle one after the other like a lemon
t for the scoop into space like an angry man
s of 2025* so far, leading to a near miss highlight
 attacking!?*
is last minute and a half is just nice overall play from them

*Quarter 3:*
enses tingle twice, with two goal-line saves back to back* (it was eventually given as a stroke, because the ump thought the second was on my body but it was full on my stick, as confirmed by the opposition dude 😂)
letely fluff the stroke
 highlights in this quarter but mainly from the other team (I think they scored 2 goals in this quarter)_

*Quarter 4:*
rner from the op, and unreal save by keeper on the drag flick
r attack goal (Goal 3)*
 how you play hockey (Goal 4)* <This message was edited>
Final result: 4-2 for Upward
Ireland unlucky again today
Harmanpreet demonstrating his excellent command of English 😉

I watch this guy who plays poker on YouTube and in one of his videos he goes 'One thing I've never told you guys is that I love apples... And bananas... AND BIG PAIRS' and he turns over pocket aces
I have packed up your stick @447757499873

 affect the price, I will also send back another stick. It is a 37.5 inch Thurso stick, it is a midbow. This is for you @447889953414. Take it back to wales with you and do what you like with it. Use it yourself, or give it to someone who needs a new stick or something, like that dude who needed one before. But I am never going to get any use out of it, and it was thrown in for free when i bought my last stick. So it is better if it goes to someone who would appreciate it. <This message was edited>
what is the Thurso like @447922463217 ?
Dunno, i have never used it on a field
fairs
It is a 70% midbow
Feels decent in the hand and when you tap about with it thi
Tho
obviously bow is shit but just wondering how it feels
Yeah not sure tbh. Although it probably wont arrive at your house until dad has gone back to wales next week, so you can tap around with it
the osakas look nice @447922463217 but the prices are brazy
£145 for a 40% stick
So real
And 220 for a 70%
Like go fuck yourself

Classic bit of wrestling commentary, in response the crowd in Brisbane chanting "He's a wanker!",
sponse from the crowd. I mean what have Australians ever done? Crocodile Dundee, Bluey, koalas with clamydia?
Did you remember to do this?

Has anyone else got a small at Fishguard for their playing shirt

Nowhere near
It is way too small
My medium is tight tbf
Nobody can fit their head through the hole
They are a bit cozy on the noggin

They were chatting the whole game
Got like 3 cards for chart and a match day red after the game...
Also the other team got the straight dog brigade. Between the players, coaches and a couple supporters, they have like 5 dogs

Long game
What did they get the red for?
