You can pull URLs from packet capture, even for https because the initial connection is unencrypted. Many protocols start in clear text then negotiate encryption, so there's often the chance of a small leak. Even when connections are fully encrypted, you can still gather information about source and destination, can potentially infer what's going on.Hazy on details because it's some years since I worked on this kind of thing, but I've eyeballed a lot of pcap files.

Would this be during a stretch in the civil service, by any chance?
My civil service experience is not huge, and I understand it varies from dept to dept, but in general it is an organisation that places weight on job titles. Job titles tell you your job responsibilities, communicate your relative superiority, and even things like who it's ok for you to be talking to. I'm suspicious of job titles in general but I think civil service job titles, especially as people get more senior, translate out of the organisation very poorly.
Here's an example you'll probably find pretty jarring. The job title is "Agile coach" but the work is "conducting Service Discovery to identify and deliver high-quality, user-centred products that positively impact the lives of offenders, prison staff and society as a whole".I don't know what the right title is, but agile coach feels like the wrong one to me.

üëã I've not used it, but my inclination would be to prefer it over Substack. This is partly, although far from entirely, influenced by the fact I know people in their support team.
You do get significantly more for rather less money with Ghost. If you're aiming to "build a brand", which in a way I guess you are, the fact that emails come from _you_ rather than from _Substack_ would be enough for me by itself.
More broadly, Ghost and the company behind it, seems to have a clear focus on who they are and the service they provide. They're also quite clear on what they aren't, and what they don't (and won't) provide.
Substack, corporately, haven't been around as long and seem rather less focussed on what they do. I suspect they're more interested in generating some kind of return on the big chunk of VC money. Some of that apparently involves paying advances/inducements to some people to move to Substack, and some of those are people you might not want to be associated with.
I would have loved to but I'm sick as all hell. I'm delighted you're all having a good time, and that I can weakly follow along here.

If you fancy a dev conference at short notice, NorDevCon, is next week.

Thanks chum, I appreciate it üôÇ I don't really have any doubt I can stand up and talk for an hour, but I've never tried to do a talk like this before. I described it as 'as near to a personal philosophy of software development as I'm likely to write'.
In writing it, I've not cited anyone - if this is my reckons I should stand behind it all, not lean on someone else - and I'm also trying not use established jargon. People have ideas and opinions about, say, 'agile development' and so I want to avoid them projecting that onto what I'm saying instead of getting what I mean.So, does what I want to say hang together, but can I land it? Well, I think so and I'll find out on Thursday üôÇ

Fox in the garden earlier. Dogs very agitated, but fox just turned around and bimbled off out of site. #incidentalUrbanWildlifeObservation
Foxes are pretty common here, although this particular one is particularly bold and is often out in daylight. In the past we've had foxes raise cubs in the garden, and for a while some badgers took up residence under the shed too. They've moved out, but are still fairly frequent visitors.I suspect once the building finishes, things move back in relatively quickly - especially if they are gaps in the fences or if they dig under them.

Doing a bit of recreational programming. For [reasons], haven't done any of that for weeks, months even. For coming up on four years, I've slowly (very slowly!) been reimplementing the programs presented in Kernighan and Plauger's wonderful book, Software Tools in Pascal. 
Because I'm old, although not as old as Ken and Bill, I'm working C++. I'm part way through `edit`, which is a simple line editor of the type you get when you accidentally put `vim` into `ex` mode.

But I think I'd worked my way into a bit of a corner. I need to be able to handle regex searches too.

A project I worked on, although I was peripheral to this particular part, purposefully overtrained neural networks on videos. The aim was to be able to say, with confidence, whether a clip or edit was a genuine extract from the source video or a modified (whether malicious out not) extract. You couldn't have general detection, it had to be specific. Generalised anything seems unachievable (let alone desirable) to me.
Cluck!

Double duty? Blimey, well done chum.
For the first time in a very long time, I used the sat-nav feature on the CycleStreets android app today. And you know what? We did a really good job on that thing. It's really good!
We being me, and my fellow contributors, chief among them Oliver Lockwood and Hilary Newmark. I am indebted to them both, and to Simon Nuttall and Martin Lucas-Smith who run the CycleStreets back end that serves up the mapping and routing data the app uses. They're the tops.
I don't use the app that often at the moment because I'm usually taking local trips where I already know where I'm going. Indeed that was the case today - I walked (across the border) to Stirchley to pick up my bike from the shop and ride it home. I popped the app on anyway, just because I could. And, you know, we should use our own software now and again.
Dogfooding. We used to talk about that a lot, but it seems to have fallen out of the "discourse". Whether that's because we take it for granted (which from my observation, at least, we probably can't) or just because it's not fashionable, I don't know. Anyway, that was part of the reason.
And the other part was, hey, I wrote a sat-nav! An actual sat-nav, that will tell you how to get places. With maps, and distances, and the next turn, and all that. That's not a thing most people get to do, and I did. That's a pretty cool bit of software to have written.
The latest update to the CycleStreets Android app will go live in the next few days. The first release was in June 2011, so we're just coming up on twelve years. In app terms, that means it's been around since basically the beginning of time. (Do you remember Android 4? Ha, you crazy kids these days. Don't know you're born.)
The install base sits at around ten thousand, which simultaneously makes it the most used software I've ever written but still doesn't seem like very many. (Active installs were significantly higher during lockdown and have been falling back to the 10,000 level over the last year or so, which is kind of sad. I don't mean for us, but for what it says about how people choose or feel able to travel around.)
We aren't the only cycle routing app in town, obviously, although we've outlasted a few over the past dozen years. The only one I'm really familiar with is CityMapper, which does a really good job of multi-modal travel.
Maybe I'm missing something, and one of those other apps is so good we should shut up shop. Well, maybe. But I don't see them as competitors.I just want more people to be able to walk and cycle, and a free app is small part of helping enable that. We're open source, don't charge, won't track your data, and don't show you ads. 
We're don't do that alone, we're part of the wider community of apps and services that builds on OpenStreetMap, one of the /great/ open projects.
Of course the &lt;enormous proverbial animal&gt; of routing apps on Android is Google Maps. Google Maps offers different routing modes for driving, walking, public transport, and cycling. The cycling mode rolled out during 2010 and 2011. Huh, look at that, they've been doing cycle routing 12 years too.
I don't know if I wish they'd never bothered or if I wish they'd do it so well they'd run the rest of out of town, but the current state of cycle routing on Google Maps? It's awful. In fact, it's worse that awful, I believe it's actively dangerous.
I should say here that I'm speaking for myself here. I don't represent CycleStreets in any kind of official capacity and I am not speaking for them.
A journey I used to take all the time, is across Birmingham from my house to the headquarters of West Midlands Fire Service.It's only about 3 and half miles, so exactly the kind of short urban journey that should be cycleable. (And which many of our continental neighbours wouldn't even think of driving.)
Here's the route Google Maps suggest I take.Looks pretty direct, right? What could be simpler?
Here's an enormous, busy, high-speed roundabout it wants us to cycle across.
Survived that? Then steel yourself for another...
And another...
For the majority of the journey, essentially once you turn out of the end of my road, Google Maps suggests you ride on an arterial road until you get to the ring road, and then negotiate three of the biggest, busiest, fastest roundabouts in the city to cycle around the ring road, presumably while you pray to whatever god you believe in to keep you from harm.
If you try and ride this route, you are actively in harm's way. It's simply not safe. On the other hand, if you look at that and think "I'll take the car", there are other, externalised, harms. This is a dangerous route.
Twelve years and the best the combined resources of Google can do is put people in danger.
Here's what CycleStreets suggests.You can see it in more detail at 
At first glance it looks wiggler and longer than Google Maps' route, but it's pretty much bang on the same distance. More to the point, it keeps you away from major roads. Where it can, it uses cycle paths - about half the distance is entirely off-road and along the canal. Google suggests you try and turn right across multiple lanes of traffic, at a roundabout, while cycling up a slope. CycleStreets says "you know what? hop off and use the crossing".
It's a safe route. It's a route you could give to a new cyclist, or someone unfamiliar with the city with a degree confidence.A two man organisation on a shoestring budget and a handful of volunteers are giving you safe routes. Google employs over 190,000 people and turned over $279.8 billion last year. They could give you safe routes. Easily. Quickly. They could certainly do it without spending even a penny more. But they don't because, as an organisation, your safety doesn't matter.

At the arse end of the 80s my friend John &amp; I produced a number of event posters for the University Rock club. We did a lot of Xerox art, tried to pay attention to lettering (or at least legibility), as well as the odd original drawing.

I've just found a little cache of those posters and, actually, most of them aren't that great, but this one still tickles me.

I think the boring adulting answer is you do need a human in the loop, specifically an IFA. Your next question should then be "can anyone recommend an IFA?"

This is a kind of where I was going with the "can anyone recommend an IFA" question. Financial products are complicated, everybody wants something slightly different, everyone's circumstances are their own. A good IFA can, I believe based on my experience, make a genuine difference. Perhaps difference is the wrong word, but I trust his advice and it takes a load off the list of things I need to think about.

For the past, blimey, coming up four years, I've been working my through Software Tools in Pascal, reimplementing Kernighan and Plauger's little Unix-lite tools in C++.
By last August, I'd made it as far as chapter 6, which builds an ex like editor. Obviously the world doesn't need another editor - it doesn't need any of the programs I've written for this - but I've come this far and I'm no stopping now. For various reasons, none of them especially troubling or important, I haven't touched this code since March, nor written anything up since November. But I'm doing some now.  Here we go.
What's the first thing you do with  a laptop you haven't fired up in a while? Install a pile of updated packages, obviously.
Aaaaand reboot.
Start CLion, which is a jolly good IDE. I pay money for it and everything.And update üò¢
That took a while. So what the hell was I doing last time?
Looks like I was working on forwards and backwards searching. The editor reuses a little text pattern matcher so you can search forward and backwards through your text. That leads onto the Vim classic s/&lt;something&gt;/&lt;else&gt;/g commands, which I think was where I was heading last time.
I'll have a little look and see if I can pick up the thread.
I'm not porting Kernighan and Plauger's code, by the way. That would be silly. I try not to refer to it at all. Instead I work from their description of the programs, which are very thorough, and write my own implementation.
My little parser handles straightforward commands like 1,$por /fridge/ibut chokes on w newfile.txtand 1,$s/good/bad/g is right out. There's a place to work.
You all speak ex aka Vim right?
Just :q! to leave this thread.

Not sure has_line_numbers_when_forbidden();is a great function name, but you can probably guess what it does, right?
Squared away the error cases
I'm not proud of if (!std::isspace(input_pop()) || input.is_eol())     failed();because there are side effects and short circuiting in play.On the other hand, splitting out the conditions into two ifs is worse, input_pop() is safe if we're already at eol, and well, parsers. They're often full of stuff like this. Right?
I think, because I've been a little overenthusiastic, that I'm can now parse the q command as well. I'll sling in some tests and find out.
I absolutely am, but the command parser tests are table driven so they look like this {"edit file",             {"e f.txt",  0, 0},   {0,  0,  'e', "f.txt"}},which is test name, input state consisting of line to parse, current line, last line (here, the buffer is empty), expected command (start index, end index, command code, additional stuff)
For years, even decades, I used a decendent of Michael Feathers' original CppUnit, but these days use Catch2, which is rather more capable and has nice integration with CLion. The table driven thing I picked up from Spock, though, which was my favourite test framework on the JVM.
Yep!
The arc of C++ evolution tends towards eliminating the preprocessor. Popping another macro processor into the build though? You're wild man!

I got back into boardgames in a fairly hefty way when my kids were small.

Back on my slow stroll through rewriting Software Tools in Pascal in C++. This is a book I've read cover to cover I don't know how many times in the past thirty years, but I find new facets in each time, and particularly as I'm writing code along with it.
We're all (and by all I mean Vim-speaking) familiar with the providing line numbers to a command    1,$s/x/y/.,.+10d that kind of thing. Strictly speaking those are line expressions, rather than line numbers, but that starts to feel like splitting hairs.But did you know, because I sure as hell didn't, know you can provide an arbitrary number of line expressions?
When I read that in STinP, I thought it was just a little quirk of their implementation, and didn't really think anything about it. I wrote my command parser to eat as many expressions as you give it, then just hand out the last two.Because that makes sense right? Treating 1,2,4,8,16d as 8,16d just seems sensible.
And then last night I read this ..."A line number expression can be arbitrarily complex, so long as it lies between 0 and $, inclusive. And there can be any number of expressions, so long as the last one or two are legal for the particular command. Thus \\function\\;\\\\finds the second previous function declaration and /begin/;//;//;//pprints from the third suceeding line containing begin to the fourth, inclusive."Whoa! What now?
(Context: \\&lt;pattern&gt;\\ searches backwards, /&lt;pattern&gt;/ searches forward. \\\\ and // search backwards or forwards using the most recent pattern again. function and begin are Pascal keywords.)
The key here is the difference between using , and ; as the separator between the line expressions. Using ; updates the current line number to the value of the expression. That's it!That's the key. Multiple line expressions aren't a quirk of Kernighan and Plauger's little line editor, it's a deliberate part of ed, and consequently ex, and vi, and vim, and presumably other editors too. Bananas.
My editor doesn't yet support ; properly. You can pop one in as a separator, but I'm not doing anything special with it. K&amp;P's editor operates as it parses each command. If they see a ; the just update the current line right there and then. That's a reasonable choice given their various constraints (writing didactic code in Pascal, in late 70s, for people who've never heard of Unix).
My code has a hard divide between command parsing and execution. If you give my editor a command that makes no sense, then nothing should happen. Either it all works, or nothing works. To evaluate the line expressions, I'll need to update the current line without updating the current line while parsing, then actually update the current line when executing. An extra level of indirection should do it üòÄ
5 commits, 3 files changed, 87 insertions, 48 deletionsThat all went pretty well. The four commits were gentle preparations to actually pulling the trigger, all three lines of it, and implementing the new functionality in the last commit. And then fixing a classic C++ blunder (function argument evaluation order!) to actually making it work. 
Oh hang on. Pulling the trigger in half the functionality - evaluating the line expressions - but not updating the current line during command execution.Nevermind. Next time.
Moved from Birmingham to Pembrokeshire 5 weeks ago. Just sat down and sharpened my hedge trimmer.That's how quickly I'm adjusting. Oh yea. Fully rural.
Yes, Dan Abnett has become one of Britain's unsung comics greats. The Out is spectacular, allowing Mark Harrison the kind of free reign he's not had since he was a teenager drawing for White Dwarf, Brink is particularly terrific, and I'd add Kingdom too. The first book of that was so solid and satisfying, I thought a sequel would only diminish it, but shame on me.
You might also want to look at Ian Edginton's work. He's always good, always interesting, and also from Birmingham üòä I'd particularly recommend his work with D'Israeli - Levithan, Stickleback, and Scarlet Traces
Have you read any of Moore's From Hell partner-in-crime Eddie Campbell? As a long time reader, it's hard to pick an outright favourite, but Graffiti Kitchen, How To Be An Artist, or in a very different vein The Amazing Remarkable Monsieur Leotard are all worth your time.
He's definitely on the Naughty Paul Taylor list. Blimey.
The lepidoptera love my washing. Not sure what this is, some kind of hawk moth?
One of  his strengths on display in those series is writing to the artist. I'd argue that The Out is Harrison's best work, Kingdom was Elson's, and Brink is up there for Culbard. It's certainly hard to imagine anybody else drawing those particular series.
The way Jim Maxwell says "the new NUT" cracks me up every time. #TheAshes #TMS #cricket

You should!

I'm sure there were times before, but the earliest I remember Foucault's Pendulum, which makes me sound more literary than I am. More recently, I would have stayed up all night with The Goblin Emperor, if only that book were longer.

So it started with "Your app currently targets API level 30 and must target at least API level 31" and now I'm on an upgrade spiral that might never end ...
Netball is top telly sport.
At one of my formative jobs, I once spent over a week trying to get a clean build of our whole system. We didn't have any kind of CI (because almost none of us had ever heard of it, and even if they had it wasn't that kind of organisation), so I built each chunk by hand - build the HP-UX server, regenerate the Corba bindings, wizard up the skeleton for the Windows side of the Corba bindings, fix the bit that had changed, build the Windows component, move to the next one.
By the time I'd got to the top, something at the bottom would have changed, and I'd have to start all over again. I did got there in the end, strode out into the corridor in triumph, then spent about the next hour swearing loudly about how we'd never actually ship anything if we didn't sort this shit out. (Shortly afterwards all our dev teams were rearranged to have vertical slices not horizontal, although I didn't connect that up to my losing my temper at the time.)
Anyway, trying to bump one target SDK level on this Android app is giving me those same miserable feels. Every time I change one piece, I need to change another, which triggers something else, which breaks the build, which needs another tweak, and round and around.
How fitted is it, if that's not a silly question. I've found 4G routers can be very sensitive to comparatively small caves in aerial position - even a 50cms or so can be enough to go from "not quite" to"manageable".
Bloody hell. I think I've actually done it.
At last!
I keep going back to the Travis-CI console to look at the little green badge and the log entry that says _Done. Your build exited with 0._
But what about tomorrow breakfast?
It doesn't work like that for me. I'm never too hungover, or ill, or indeed anything, to not have breakfast. And there is little better fit breakage than a couple of samosas or a bit of bhel chaat.
Sadly, rare treats now I've moved out of the big city, but there are other benefits like not being in the big city.

If I'm remembering properly, you have to be able to make a positive case FOR the need for javascript.

Can be difficult though, right? I think I was about 20 years in before I started to get on top of this. Part of that was realising that I had been unfairly critical of other people - generally in their absence, it must be said, although I don't know if that's better or worse.
Now I try to assume that people are doing the best they could at the time. I don't know what the constraints were, or what other circumstances or situations were in play. In the now, we have what we have, so let's work with that.I give that to myself as well, and try to take comments through that lens. That didn't necessarily mean the comments are meritless. Perhaps I could have done better. Maybe there's something I didn't know. So, I can try again.
I try to take comments in a positive way. Otoh, sometimes  they are just mean, or I'm not actually the real audience, or whatever. In which case, not worth worrying about.

A number (I don't how many) of odd behaviours in a set of multithreaded COM objects and Windows services went away in course of, for example, switching from raw BSTR to bstrt_t, using scoped locking objects rather than raw Windows API calls, vectors in place of raw arrays,...I'm sure there were others, but that was the most dramatic. There was nothing obviously wrong with the code, but without intending to "fix" anything, I definitely did.

Pounds, shillings, _and_ pence?
I moved to Milton Keynes in 1991, and they did kerbside recycling collection. We had three bins - cans/glass, paper/card, everything else. That was over 30 years ago. I've been separating my recyclables ever since, even when where I was living wasn't doing kerbsire collection.
Down here in Pembrokeshire, we have 6 bins - paper, cardboard, glass, cans and hard plastics, food waste, non-recyclable. Non-recyclables only get picked up every 3 weeks, 3 bags max. And you know what? It's not a problem.I just don't understand why it's still controversial. It's makes no sense. There's entire generations - which Sunak is a part of - for which this is an entirely normal thing that everybody does and he unveils like it's some kind of bold epiphany. Wtf?
Ah, debugging the bwk way üôÇI've spent most of today working in a very Steve Maguire mode. Sometimes you just have to.
In Debugging The Development Process (1994) he recommends stepping through every line of code you write in the debugger.I've spent all day working on a plugin to an application, working against a rather crappy API, and it's the only practical way to verify what you've written does what you expect.

Some cars might be less fuel efficient at 20mph than 30mph, but over the kind of distances weree talking about you'll still use less fuel going at 20mph because the cost of accelerating to 30 is so high. You also get large reductions in particulates from brakes and tyres. But the anti-20 brigade don't care because people will say literally anything to try and justify why they should be able to drive as fast as they like where ever they like.

What I'll never stop being salty about, though, is the opposition, Cardiff &amp; Met, didn't offer us teas after the game. We travelled a 5 hour round trip to play them, they're currently making a lot of noise about what a big &amp; successful club they are, they use the rather good facilities at Cardiff Metropolitan University, but they can't put together a cup of tea and few chip butties for the opposition.

I clicked the link, but my basket was empty &amp; my card didn't appear to have been charged. Ah well.
Saturday night, I tried again, this time using PayPal. Again a receipt, again a follow up 26 minutes later saying "don't forget to checkout". This time I had been charged. Still now download.
Shortly after that, my card was charged from the day before. Still no magazine.
Compose lengthy email to customer support asking from my money back. I mean it's probably in vain, but you never know.
Google "Edge December 2023 download". Hit first link &amp; hit the first link on that page. Bish bosh.

I'm always, always torn about remakes. Even when they turn out pretty great (thinks hard) like Abel Ferrara's Bodysnatchers, I'm uncomfortable with the hubris that says "there's something there, but I could do it better".But also yes, Highlander 2 was absolute garbage from the start, despite Michael Ironside's heroic efforts to gurn it back to watchability.

Heading out on a five hour round trip to our hockey match. There are 6 of us in this car, plus kit, plus keeper kit, and it's already getting a little gamey in here.
This is all part of the low-grade hockey experience, at least outside of the biggest cities. My old club back in Birmingham travels pretty much inside a 15 mile radius. Hockey in Wales is skews heavily toward south Wales, particularly Cardiff,which is what you'd expect. For us out here in Pembrokeshire it means pretty much every away game is something of an undertaking.
SAM!
Team sport's great. Everyone should do it.
(It'd make it easier to arrange local fixtures, for a start)
This is not a health and fitness thing BTW. I mean you might get a bit fitter, but that'd be by accident, and it's entirely possible to play 20 games a season for years and years while remaining objectively unfit and carrying an injury.

I've just seen the Tesco Christmas ad and I have never felt less festive.
I feel weirdly tainted by the big Christmas "event" ads this year. My late great uncle was a songwriter and something of his was used in a recent Waitrose ad, for a big posthumous payday. He left a share of his royalties to my Mum, which is now mine and my brothers and so we're all retrospective participants in the whole unpleasantness.

The Tesco ad (which is the price I have to pay to watch Taskmaster) is a Dad passive-aggressively torturing his son until he breaks down and joins in the "fun".
Mind-bogglingly, the best Christmas advert on Channel 4 is Amazon's.
Happily, I gave up trying to find life's narrative thread years ago. There ain't nobody at the wheel, and nothing makes sense.
There's curling on the iPlayer. I have an idea you'd want to know.

"Further, the browser renders the WebPage by executing the code line-by-line, so any operation on the website involving One-line functions will respond much more quickly as compared to the normal functions.‚ÄùI mean this might have been adjacent to the truth in 1995, maybe.
I was noodling away on my little amusement of writing the Kerninghan and Plauger's software tools, of Software Tools and Software Tools in Pascal fame, in C++ (four years in and still going!). 
At the moment (and by moment, I mean past 15 months) I'm poking at at edit, a cut down version of ed, the original Unix editor.As I was finishing up for the evening, I saw something that irked me and it's been working away at me ever since.
auto line = stiX::getline(in);auto parsed_command = parse_command(line);auto command = parsed_command.compile(buffer_);buffer_.set_dot(command.dot);command(in, out, buffer_, filename_);
Read a line, which is some kind of command - 1,$p or something, normal vi talkParse that line outCompile into a command. The command that comes back is always runnable. If the line we typed makes no sense, we return an error object. (Two patterns for the price of one üòÆ)Update the current line Execute the command
That's all fine. Except. Except.     buffer_.set_dot(command.dot);is arse-backward.
It's rubbed me wrong all day.
All day, I've been thinking I should swap it around, from buffer_.set_dot(command.dot); to command.apply_dot(buffer_); or something like that.
But what's the very next line? command(in, out, buffer_, filename_);command and buffer_ again. Doh! There shouldn't even be two calls. The set_dot call should be folded into the command execution. 
I'd been intending to do a one line change - the _obvious_ change, 2 minute job, just to smooth things out, make it easier to read - but until you get the code in your hands, you never really know what it's going to tell or what you're going to do with it.
Thirty years, I've been doing this, (forty if you're feeling generous) and the code can still surprise me.

There is a lot of software development in and around Birmingham, but in the 30 years I lived in the area I didn't get a huge amount of local work and I don't really know why.

Hmm. From your videos I would have said you do, pretty much, but maybe I need to watch some of those again.For me, my immediate feeling is that I don't make a list - I have an idea, usually, but it's not formalised as a list. That means when I get to Kent's 5th step I'm much more in a "where does this take me" more than "what's still on the list". But I guess I need to look at myself again too.

Still on the way or going back already?
Yes, very much this! (Apart from the guilt part - I'm sure you are not horrible.)When things are difficult - there's time pressure, the code is awkward, or some other particular stressor - that's when I lean hardest into my practice.

Presumably someone click Yes to this, but I absolutely guarantee it wasn't clear that Onedrive would shove its way in, move stuff around, convert a load of stuff into 'virtual files', and muck up the cloud sync I'd actually installed.
Actually, now I know this, it explains why Natalie thought this machine was slower than the ten year old machine it replaced. None of the files were actually on the super speedy SSD, they were floating around in a data centre somewhere.

Why not? I think you'd be good at it. However, I think you'll need to be clear on how you address the status of an individual member while also working at Element. Decisions the Board make might affect Element, directly or otherwise, and your participation in those may raise questions.I believe you would act independently, but you'll need to have a clear policy on this - one that faces inwards to Element, and outward to the wider community
On the Element side, there are a couple of obvious cases - Element has a position on something before the board, how is that communicated to you (if at all) - you have, just because of your work, knowledge of something within Element that has bearing on Board work, how do you acknowledge that (if indeed you're able)
I don't know enough to know how common either of these scenarios will be, but I wouldn't expect you to constantly have to recuse yourself, but you'll need to be clear on your reasoning in each case.

This isn't an overstretched metaphor at all. We've seen the real world consequences before. It was feeding cow derived meal to cows that caused BSE and vCJD.

We could have avoided the whole situation by just not doing the bad thing in the first place.Let's not do the bad thing.

Unfortunately I doubt we'll get that post-mortem, but I'd be willing to bet money it's not a few "bugs", it's that the system as specified was incomplete at best and just plain wrong at worst, that the implementation of those specs was poor, and from that shitty start, patch upon bodge upon cock up.

Quite fancy doing a space science MSc.
Build another mass spec, do some cosmochemistry.
Way back at the start of what I laughingly called my career I worked in a space science lab at the Open University. I helped built what I believe was world most precise static vacuum mass spectrometer for analysing C12/C13 ratios.
We could measure the isotopic signature of methane in 10cc of air. No one else got close to that.
I took part in exactly one experiment, when Dr Andy Morse and I measured the deuterium/hydrogen ratio of solar wind trapped in the lunar regolith.
Our results were exactly in line with predictions, disappointingly giving succour to the moon-landings-were-a-fake nutters.
I mean, there's no way the experiment we ran was even conceivable in the 60s so exllent work to whomever it was who cooked up that sample, and stored it in clean conditions for 30+ years, before two scruffy herberts in a lab in Milton Keynes sat up for 20 hours straight cooking the shit out of the little sample.
Andy gave me the sample afterwards and I carried it round in a my wallet for a good while until I was asked to give it back for a Nasa stock take.
A bit of the moon.
I had a bit of the moon in my pocket. People were strapped to a hundred metre tall barrel of explosives, fired across the vacuum of space, to the actual moon to collect it, and I had in my bloody pocket.
The audacity of it. The bravery of it.
Anyway, quite fancy doing a bit more of that, really.
Why wouldn't you? It goes to the very heart of where we come from, and who doesn't think about that at least sometimes.
So he writes thorough specs, which he admits are immediately out of date, so he rewrites those and that is not wasted time. Capturing the spec in tests, however, is wasted time? Yea, makes total sense. I'm immediately convinced that I should discard everything I've learned since 1999 and return once more to hours in Microsoft Word, chasing sign offs, arguing about bug vs change, and all that other entirely worthwhile stuff.

Put together an iterator over the tree. Ui component just works through the iterator, so to it the page elements just appear to be a linear sequence. The iterator, by whatever means, knows which nodes to expand or skip. The tree stays a tree, the Ui list stays a list, the iterator does the clever stuff.

You work fast, my friend. You work fast.
"The Post Office is a long-standing British institution about which people get dewey eyed and emotional about which has been infected by a capitalist ideology which does not allow for self-reflection."The reason the Post Office can bring its own prosecutions is because it predates the established police forces. When you say that out loud, it's so clearly an anachronism but, as you say, the system had been working as intended. Changing the law takes time and effort, so where's the need?
Now, thanks to that capitalist ideology, thrust upon a public service, we're looking at almost unprecedented legal changes to absolve some of the victims, and probably further legislation to remove the Post Office's powers, greater (or purportedly greater) regulatory oversight. Earlier in a parliament, I'd expect a tory government to work towards putting the whole operation out of business, but we can at least look forward to them being punted into the political long grass for some time
I know this isn't a real question, but I do think it had a real answer, which is 2003 or so, and then again in about 2015.

So this is what we're buying from, believe it or not, the Barony of Cemais. It's a little packet of common land. We, that is all the householders surrounding plus us (we're down that lane heading off in the top left), are buying it jointly and putting it into a trust so it will remain as common land for the indefinite future.
In fact, it the land couldn't be anything but common at the moment, but a future change in planning law and who knows? Well, we do üôÇ
Quite why the Barony is selling it is a little unclear to me - it was offered for sale to residents by letter last year, which simply mentioned "rationalising the land holdings". There are at least two other smaller packets elsewhere on the village they've offered. None of them has any commercial value, so perhaps they're just trying to wring whatever they can out of it. But why now, rather than any time in the past 1000 years, well, who knows?
Perhaps I should get myself along to the next Mayor Making ceremony and try and engage the Baron in conversation?

Caught this from the train as I left Ely. Those are cormorants sitting in a tree together. The Fens are weird.
I know cormorants aren't exclusively coastal any more - I've seen them from Westminster Bridge in London, and on a reservoir in Coventry - but to see so many in one place, without an obvious large body of water, seems pretty strange. I mean Ely isn't exactly dry, but it's a landscape of drains and pools, not lakes and rivers.

Could have killed a bit more, tbh
Over the past four or five months, I've been pulled into the recruiting process at work. I say pulled in because I didn't have any prior experience or training in recruiting, and because I'm not sure our process is particularly great. I don't think it's bad, necessarily, but it is quite drawn out. At least, I think so although people tell me it's not unusual. Anyway...
As part of the process, we give people a "refactoring exercise". It's a small chunk of not very good real code, and ask people to make it better. We're deliberately a bit vague about what that might be, because we don't want to steer people in any particular direction. We have a good read through, and then we have a call to talk about what they've done, how they found it, what they were thinking about and aiming for, do a bit of pairing on the code, explore the paths untaken.
It's in this conversation where I generally get involved and, actually, it can be a lot of fun. People take it all kinds of ways, and have lots of different ideas, and I've had some really good conversations with people.
When it's not fun, though, it can be really quite depressing. People who look like they should be good candidates - six or seven or eight years in, working in the same sector, for well known companies, who are bright and pleasant - turn out to be pretty poor programmers.
We're not looking for perfection. I'm not looking for people to reproduce what I did when I started - I'm over 50 and been working four, five, even six times longer for a start. I was able to treat the whole recruitment process in a way they can't. What I'm looking for is promise.
When I did the refactoring exercise, I treated as a piece of theatre. I ended up submitting as radical a refactoring as I could, wrapped with a set of characterising unit tests, a pageful of notes, and a git archive with 70 or 80 commits in it. I was, in very real way, showing off.
People earlier in their career don't have that freedom, which is fine, and they often seem to lack confidence. I've had a number of candidates who take the code in a particular direction and don't seem to follow through. It's like they've set off on a path, then rein themselves in. In our conversations, I try to encourage to, yeah, let's go down that path and see where it takes us. And some can, and some really can't.
If, for example, someone says "I added this interface to make things more abstract" it's natural for us to ask how it does that. It's kind of awkward when they can't answer. I don't mean they're not expressing themselves well, I mean can't answer.
Some candidates make good looking large scale changes, but seem almost blind to the smaller scale things. I have had people expressly say that didn't write tests because there was no need, but then stumble when asked how they know the code still works correctly. In as many ways as people do well, there are people who are simply floundering.
I do not blame a single one of them. I wish we could hire them, I really do, because I think there are people here who could really show them what working with code can be, what a joy, what a challenge. I don't doubt that all of them could be terrific programmers, who could really contribute, and have a good time doing it. But  we can't, at least we can't take them all.
They aren't failing candidates, they're candidates that have been failed. They've been failed by the trade at large, because collectively we know, or at least have some good ideas, about people can learn and grow their skills. They've been failed by their past employers, for not having the desire to help their own staff develop, not having the structures in place.
And they've been failed by me and my peers, who do know our stuff. It doesn't take a huge amount of time to really make a difference - half an hour here, a day or two there, even just a suggestion can change someone's course for the better.
Well, indeed. Occasionally candidates say they wrote tests but didn't submit them, in which case we all jump around going "show us!, show us!" and other times, well, we have to take the conversation in a different direction.
Yes, how is this helping, why did you introduce the interface here, whatever seems appropriate to explore the purpose, the reasons, their thinking behind what they've done. We have variations in C++, Python, C#, and something else I've forgotten. Adding an interface is really common for the C# people, but often it turns out to be some kind of reflex rather then a purposeful action.
A Pascal like language with pre- and post- conditions? Oberon? In this case, where I've thrown an arbitrary piece of code at you, putting tests around it helps characterise the behaviour. I can get an idea by reading but I might be wrong, am probably incomplete, and I'll certainly forget, but building tests captures and preserves that behaviour. Then I can change and shape the code, secure in the knowledge the tests will let me know if I cocked up.
For new itch-scratching code, then tests work the other way. They describe the behaviour I want, and that helps shape what it is I need to write. You might have seen people talk about the cycle - write a failing test (ie, write a tiny spec), make the test pass (implement the spec), refactor (improve the design). You're defined and implementing in tiny steps - I get itchy, like actively uncomfortable, if I go longer than about 8 minutes when working like this

When my Mum was in the army, back in 60s, I believe she did a stint test firing Bloodhound missiles into the sea off Saundersfoot. Except they mainly didn't because the missiles were very expensive, so they just pretended to fire missiles into the sea.Spike Milligan described his wartime training to use field artillery as something like pulling the string and shouting bang.Plus ca change, and all that
They do look nice, but it'll have to be pretty special to be better than one of these

For the past 20 years I've been recording the first ice cream van of the year. For a longitudinal study like this I'm still in the early stages of the data gathering, but the initial results are promising. However, while I previously lived in Birmingham, I now live in Pembrokeshire. By the seaside.You can see why this might be a problem. Consequently, I'm looking for Birmingham-based people to become field agents. The duties are quite light but, I hope, rewarding.
Projections for this year suggest a first Ice cream van sighting on or around the afternoon of 15th March, with an envelope of +6/-5 days.However, early outliers are possible, so if you are interested please get in contact at your earliest convenience.
While distant jingles help fill the picture, the rigours of science requires a sighting  please - ideally van name, location, time, and jingle. Any incidental details - was there a queue, anything novel on the menu, nice and clean or a bit scummy looking etc - are at the observers discretion.
If you see an ice cream van out late in Glasgow run the other way
just a nibble
It is! But science demands data! (You know that!)Date, time, place? Jingle?

This is an unacknowledged failure. Or an unknown failure even.There's the old "what if we train them and they leave" chestnut, but I don't think people are being deliberately held back by a cabal of malevolent managers or anything.

Following on from my disappointment prompted by the candidates we're seeing for interview, I chanced upon a piece of code elsewhere and it set me off on another one
For a talk I'm thinking about for later this year, early next, I've decided I need a text prediction engine. The basic idea is that there are lots of things in software that seem kind of amazing, even to people who work in software. Compilers &amp; interpreters, o/ses, windowing systems are obvious choices, as is lots of games stuff (and not just fancy graphics stuff) but they're all pretty large. You can't write an o/s in 40 minutes. I can't anyway. But I think I can do a text predictor.
If I can explain how a "magic" piece of software works in 40 minutes or an hour, demystify the whole thing, that can start lift the lid for people on some of these other "hard" things.
Perhaps because my programming "first language" is C++  I've had people who work in C# or JavaScript or Python or similar say that all that low-level stuff is too complicated for them. I've encountered a lot of C++ (and C and assembler) snobs who look down the noses at languages you can't cause segfault with, but they're probably beyond redemption. It kind of boils my piss that there are programmers who've taken that on themselves. Programming's programming.
My phone keyboard asked me last week if I wanted to turn on some kind of AI assistant. I obviously said no, but it's stoking up the idea that text prediction is a hard problem, best left to the big brains at Google/Apple/Microsoft with their shiny offices and free lunches on Silicon Valley and Redmond.A text predictor in few lines of JavaScript should pop that bubble. A bit. Hopefully.
Why JavaScript? Well, a) Everyone can read itandb) People shit on it all the time (even though its actually really capable)
Anyway, I've no idea what I'm doing beyond the phrase "markov chain", so here goes.
(I have written a satnav though, with turn-by-turn directions and speech and dynamic replanning andd all that good stuff. It's pretty good!)
Tool shaming. Don't do it. 
Markov chains are stochastic models of event sequences, where the probability of the next event only depends on the current event. Helpful.
For text prediction, this means we take the current word - let's say "hello" - and randomly select the word that comes next.But if we randomly select a word, doesn't that just mean it could be anything?Well no, because I skipped over the model part.
Get my tekkers üôÑ
Before we start predicting we build the model. We read a lot of text and every word we encounter, we make a note of the words that come immediately afterwards. For "hello", let's says that it's followed by "world", "Dolly", and "everybody".Our prediction for the word following "hello" will be one of those three words.
But we don't just note those following words, we keep track of how often they occur. Imagine "world" follows "hello" three times, "Dolly" once, and "everybody" twice. Our prediction is going to choose one of those three words, but the selection will be weighted by how often they occurred. Here we'd expect "world" to come up more often than "everybody", for example.
The particular words and their weights will depend on your text corpus - the complete works of Jane Austen is going to end up with quite a different model to that of yesterday's football commentary, which will be different again to a model built from what you've typed into your phone.
(We can make things sound more artificial intelligency by saying "training" instead of "building". Training makes things sound like Neo in the Matrix, while building sounds boring and mechanistic but actually they mean exactly the same.)
Tea break 
I've been poking around with code alongside these ramblings. It's taken a bit longer than 40 minutes (not an excuse, but I've been watching the FIH ProLeague hockey at the same time), but I think I'm almost there.

And here it is predicting
The core of a text prediction engine in 66 lines of JavaScript. Not bad. It's a bit late to feed it the complete works of Jane Austen this evening, but maybe that's where I'll go next time.

As I read the source text to build my markov chain model, I am tokenising in the simplest way that could possibly work function tokenise(input) {   return input.split(' ') }It's don't get no simpler than that. Trouble is, if we get a blank line - which is of no use - this will still squirt out an empty string, which the chain will tuck away. If there are extra spaces they won't get stripped. Punctuation will pass write through to so "hello", "hello," and "hello!" all end up in the model.
function tokenise(input) {   return input.split(' ') }This returns an array, but I'm going to flip this to a generator, because it'll be easier to muck around with later.function* tokenise(input) {   yield* input.split(' ') }Boom!Now, instead of returning an array, we're returning an iterator over that array. Slightly astonishingly, at our call sitefor (const token of tokenise(line)) { ... }nothing has to change.
JavaScript generator functions are great and everybody should be using them a whole lot more than they are. About 8 years ago, I gave a talk in which I said they were the future and it looks like we're just starting to get there.
Let's strip out those empty strings function* tokenise(input) {   for (const token of input.split(' '))     if (token !== '')       yield token }Watson had heard a fierce eddy between eight years of a straight from you. We know nothing which is the old gentleman's father. I for the wall was possible to get out if he was comfortable, and veil, all three long step and for a private business. We had no exit?" "None." Hmm, better already.
Let's think about punctuation. Right now "hello", "hello!", etc etc are all different. We could just strip out all punctuation, but I think it'll be more fun to keep them in there are tokens in their own right. Can't think of a neat way to do that.
The long way round then. I hate it,but it works. function* tokenise(input) {   for (const token of input.split(' '))     if (token !== '')       yield* splitComma(token) }function* splitComma(token) {   for (let t of token.split(',')) {     if (t === '')       t = ','     yield t   } }I'll fix it in post :D
OK, this is getting uncomfortably Lispyfunction* tokenise(input) {   yield* splitFullStop(splitComma(strip_blanks(split_on(input)))) }
Oh for a pipeline operator.
Huh, just realised I've been using snake_case when idiomatic JavaScript uses camelCase. Stick it in the backlog, I'm out.

I worked in Prof Colin Pillinger's lab from 91-94. I think everyone there thought there had been life on Mars (and remember at the time we thought Mars was dry) . Ironically, Everett Gibson's "Martian fossils" work made it much more difficult to say that in public. He was well liked and respected, but that result felt a bit unsupported, especially as everybody and his dog was analysising AH84001 six ways to Sunday.
I think, /think/, we saw a dipper on the stretch below this. Small bird, flying straight and low among the river, no hint of colour so not a kingfisher and too small in any case.Wouldn't have thought of it, because in my head dippers are Scottish Highlands and islands, but met a guy a couple of weeks back who said they nested along here and to keep an eye out.
On the episode of Monkey Cage, my old colleague Sara Russell describes the first time she held a meteorite in her hand, and I just had to sit down for a few minutes because it was the same for me.

Love to be offered "exciting contract opportunities" at the rate I was getting in 2001.
A few days ago I was moaning out loud about how disappointed I was for all the interview candidates we'd seen that had been ill-served by their previous employers (and more). I then happened on a piece of code I felt was indicative of something or other, pointed at it, and made all kinds of inferences about the organisations that enabled this poor bit of code to stand. 
This is what I was moaning about. But if I'm so clever, what would I do about it?
The line components = re.findall(r"\\d+", reference_match)appears in every branch of the if/else. Let's start by hoisting that up.
The unnecessary brackets in the first else body just jars. It catches the eye, but it's just visual noise.
The lines building corrected_reference aren't the same, but they are pretty similar, and we can safely combine them all together.
This is a bit of a meta-change, because you can't infer it from the code here, but canonical_form is drawn from a data file elsewhere in the source tree, and we control it. Examining that, it is safe to replace d+ with d1, and thus eliminate one of the replace calls when constructing corrected_reference
Another meta-fix - fix the 'typo' in "RefYearAbrrNumStrokeNum". That comes from the same data file. Ok, it now says "RefYearAbbrNumStrokeNum", but to me it looks better and IDE isn't putting a squiggle under it.
Those string literals give me the heebee-geebies. Replace with constants.
Group like types together in an array, test using in
Do the same on the other two branches of the if/else. Hey look, we can go up a few points on the font size
Oh yea, Python has tuples. Those groups can be tuples not arrays, so swap the [] for ()
Collapse the year = ... d1 = ... d2 = ...lines into a single line. Easier on the eye.
Pair up a type group with a little function to pull out the year, d1, d2 values. Probably a bit too much in one jump here. Ugly too. Works though, which is the main thing.
Make a little class to pair up the types and components lambda. It more typing at the top, but it's neater in the function body.
Do the same on the other two branches. The if conditions and the bodies all have the same shape. That's pretty cool. They were similar, now they're the same.
Yoink the if/else out into a function of its own
There's no need to assign year, d1, d2 in that new function. We can just return directly.
Get rid of the if/else ladder, subbing in checking each group in turn.
And that'll probably do.
Now that we've got the types grouped together, I'm think I might put the string literals back in. We only use "RefYearAbbrNum" as part of that TypeComponents object. It's not needed anywhere else, but having extra constants floating around implies that you might. Actually YearNum_Group is the constant, so lets tie thing down to that.
One last thing. I think the parameters to canonicalise_reference(reference_type, reference_match, canonical_form):are in the wrong order.reference_type and canonical_form go together. The originate in the same place in the code (from the data file I mentioned earlier). If you put them in a tuple or a little object I wouldn't argue. The thing we're working on, that we take apart and reassemble is reference_match. To me, that means it should be the first parameter we pass.
Yep, that's it, I think.
Thanks chum
This is contrived, obviously, because it's just a one function I've pulled out of larger code base. But, but, but, I do believe that now I've shoved it about that it's "better" code. If I was able to work to my way out from here, I'm confident I could make the whole thing "better". It'd be smaller, it would be easier to read, easier to change. (This isn't hypothetical - I found this code because I was talking about working on it. It's right up a number of my alleys, but sadly I couldn't)
Big finish - I'm sure I have made the code better, and I'm just as sure that I'd make the people I was working with better programmers too. I'd be better from working with them - I've learned from everyone I've ever worked with - but I'm old. I've been a lot of places, done a lot of stuff, on a lot of different code bases, with busloads of people. I know what I'm doing, and I know I could have helped. I'm sorry I couldn't take the job but it needed more time that I had. Another time, perhaps.
That all sounded rather like an advert. It isn't, at least it's not an overt one. But one day, you might need a programmer with miles on the clock, ...

Yes, that's absolutely fair. If this had been C#, which is what I'm using day to day atm, I'd probably have gone straight to a LINQ expression. There is a better way to do this in Python, but it wouldn't come, I'd moved the code quite a long way, and it seemed a reasonable place to stop. At least for now üôÇ
Python's list comprehensions are its Linq-a-like, and I had half an idea I could use one here. However, I thought list comprehensions only created new lists. I'd still have to extract the next element, and that felt clumsy.Turns out I'd only ever half used them. A list comprehension returns an iterable. next() pulls the next element off the iterable, and well, it's more pythonic.How does this look?

The ferry that goes from Fishguard kept breaking down and was recently replaced with a newer (although by no means new) ferry.

What's kind of fascinating is that the list comprehension has the exact same elements as the for-loop version, but the meaning, as you suggested initially, is really different.

I tried to do the least I could at each stage. In one place I took out two characters, in another I changed a single letter.

We require ministers to act in a dual capacity - as a member of the party and separately as a minister of the crown. That's a bit of fiction, obviously, but we've agreed it as a society.We also need to maintain the fiction.

Polling suggests they have, but they're not let that stop from making things actively worse than they've already made them.

Ok, let's see if I can remember how to do a release for the CycleStreets Android App.
Haha! I don't have to because it's all written down 
... waits anxiously ...
I don't know why I'm anxious. It's going to build and deploy file.
Because this is an Android code base with a bit of history, naturally the build log is full of deprecation warnings. 
The warnings are primarily "such-and-such method in AsyncTask has been deprecated", topped of with actually, you know what, "AsyncTask in android.os has been deprecated".I have, at various times, tried to track down what I should be replacing AsyncTask with and have got as far as "Kotlin coroutines". Which is fine, I guess, although a task is a task and a coroutine is a coroutine and those are not the same.
It'd be great if I could track down something that described, ideally in ridiculous detail, the refactoring steps that take us safely from an AsyncTask to coroutines. Or even anything at all that even give a hint. Drawn a blank so far. Pointers gratefully received.
We are green!
Oh god, now I've got remember how to promote a build in the Google Play Console.

God, or whatever, be praised - it's a deprecation warning that _actually give you the path out_
Let's see if it works!
Well, it changed a couple of things that look like they make sense. Everything builds ok, the warning's gone away. Great. (I do not know what the setting actually does.)
Ah, I think I have found out what it does.
It controls generating a build info class. Previously it created one for each module (because yes, multi-module gradle build), but the change meant it was only doing it at the top level. Moved the setting into the one module where we need it, and we're good again. Score draw on that one.

I quite like this commit, but at the same time I wonder if I'm starting to write C++ so unidiomatic that people will worry about me. 
For coming up two years, I've been working in fits and starts on a C++ version of the `ed` like line editor described by Kernighan and Plauger in chapter 6 of Software Tools in Pascal.Tonight, about a thousand lines and 260 commits later, I've think I've finished üôÇ 
Much of it is pretty straightforward. There isn't, after all, a great deal of difference between inserting text before a line and append text after a line.
Honestly, one of the things that I tripped over the most was that ed is 1-indexed not 0-indexed, but sometimes it's legitimate to reference line 0 and sometimes it isn't.
What I have been pretty pleased with is that despite working an hour or two here, an hour there, sometimes going months when I didn't touch the code, the shape of the code was good and comfortable. I didn't have to spend time refamiliarising, and when I did make some really quite radical changes they went in pretty smoothly.

Let us look at Wikipedia, which says "In software engineering, dependency injection is a programming technique in which an object or function receives other objects or functions that it requires, as opposed to creating them internally."Sounds good. It continues "Dependency injection aims to separate the concerns of constructing objects and using them, leading to loosely coupled programs."which also sounds good.
What we often see in practice is something like this void someFunction() {   var authService = DIContainer.Get("AuthService");   var subsService = DIContainer.Get("SubscriptionService");    ... }This might, if you squint a bit, have satisfied the first quote above, but it sure as hell doesn't meet the latter. However,void someFunction(authService, subsService) { ... }absolutely separates the concerns.
It really does.
If you think there's some benefit to have your objects magicked up by a DI framework from some YAML config, then sure, go ahead. It's not often the case, but it might be. But don't go round dropping references to your DI container all through your code. What you're doing there is driving a bloody great global singleton nail through the heart of your application.
Pass what you need as parameters to your functions or methods. If that's getting unwieldy packaging them up in a little parameter object, or pass them in at construction time. Function parameters the original and best dependency injection.
The Tories have become so intellectually impoverished they can't even do corruption properly any more.

At the back of last year, I was talking with  about Friday Geek‚Äôs Night Out. FGNO is a call (every Tuesday) he and his friends have to just talk programming nonsense. I sounded like a lot of fun, and although I didn‚Äôt say so I was a teensy bit jealous. He just said I should start my own. ‚ÄúYou know people, right?‚Äù he said, turning his innocent gaze upon me.So I did, and it‚Äôs unbelievably great, and encourage you to do the same.
I, like I hope all of us, have friends and fellow travellers that I know through conferences, email lists, meetups, (although generally not through work - not sure what‚Äôs going on there) etc, etc that I‚Äôve known for years, if not decades. In our case, there‚Äôs a conference where most of us would be there most years.Well, obviously that hasn‚Äôt been true quite so much recentlyAnd I _missed_ them.
So, prompted by GeePaw, I emailed them and laid out what I was thinking ‚Ä¶‚ÄãI stressed that there wasn't any obligation. You didn't have to be there every time, you didn't have to arrive at the start, and stay until the end. You could come in and out, however frequently or infrequently, nor did you have to explain. But, I hoped, we could establish that cadence so if you wanted to come, you could.
To my delight, everybody did like the sound of it. We tried, and have settled, on every second Wednesday, kick off at about 8:30pm and finish whenever.And it‚Äôs just been so fantastic.
So, if you think you have a little space something like this could fill, think about who‚Äôd you‚Äôd like there with you and ask them, because they might well have a little space too.
Yes, I'd like that

Just listened to the Afghanistan-Australia commentary, not knowing the result, and now holding in the tears #T20WorldCup
One of my neighbours is a novelist, and when she told me she immediately tried to cut herself down by saying "only the kind of thing you get in Tescos". I have subsequently reinterpreted this to mean "and actually quite successful indeed"

We use it at work (to implement a programming language, as it happens) and, well, it's fine. For me, I'm not sure there's a compelling reason to choose it over anything else, but there's nothing to disqualify it either.The main caveat I'd give is the normal small user base warning - because, relatively speaking, only a few people use it, you might come across a gap where you might otherwise expect language or library support.

Some of these turn outs are pretty grim. The Conservatives really have the country. They've been so venal, so dishonest, so cruel, so incompetent that literally millions don't see the point in actually going to vote against them.It makes a difference. Our kids are literally shorter under this government. 5 year old are 1cm shorter than they were in 2010. Life expectancy is falling. It makes a difference, but as a country we've been ground into indifference.

Lowestoft goes Labour? Lowestoft!
Oh yea, that's how we do our ridiculous elections.
polls close at 10pm, results from each constituency start coming in from around half past 11, until probably half past 7 in the morning. New PM goes off to see the King some time mid-morning, and boom, he's in the job, the previous government is out and it's all done and dusted by teatime.
I'm staying up because I want to see as many of our current shower of shit government punted as far into the sea as possible.
That's probably fair, yes, but I am actually quite hopeful. The Tories have become so hollowed out through their own in-fighting, so intellectually impoverished, that the people they have left in senior positions are useless. Worse, they're also venal, cruel, and self-serving. The incoming Labour goverent will, I honestly believe, be competent, honest, and actually do understand that the purpose of government is public service.
It won't be perfect and they won't be building a new Jerusalem overnight, but Christ on a Bike, it'll be a better country tomorrow than it is today.

Andy, this is an entirely normal thing. I'm doing it myself right now. How has it passed you by for so long?
I'd never been clear if you were also having a pee, so that's that mystery solved, but now I'm wondering if you also have the liver?
Hmm. If I replace   if (centring_) {    print_centred_line(line);    return;  }  if (!fill_)    print_line(line);  else    buffer_line(line);with   auto of = output_mode();   (this-&gt;*of)(line);is that better, and if so, for what value of better?
This is from a small nroff-a-like. fill_ flags whether we're right-justifying output, and centring_ flags whether we're centre justifying lines. They can both be active, but centring trumps right justify. I tried to combine both flags, so simplify the if/if but centring is turned on for a certain number of input lines, while fill is global, so that got messy. I thought about putting it all into one if ladder, but, well, if ladders. I always stumble over if/else if/else.
So, perhaps, because I'm currently very comfortable passing round functions and lambdas and what not, I thought about collapsing down the ifs to return a function, and just calling that.   if (centring_)    return &amp;screen_formatter::print_centred_line;  return fill_ ? &amp;screen_formatter::buffer_line : &amp;screen_formatter::print_line;That looks nicer to me, but, urg, pointer-to-member-functions.   (this-&gt;*of)(line);is such a motherful.
It's such a mouthful, you hardly ever see it, and it feels like a real throw back to the very early days of C++ when everyone was very keen on making sure you knew C inside out first and could navigate your ways through a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to an int, or some similar nonsense.
Sun's just come out. Off to mow the grass with a push mower. Everything will be clearer after that.
How does std::invoke(output_mode(), this, line);feel?
Centring is spelt wrong, isn't it?
Part of the motivation for trying to shift that if ladder, is that it takes a 16 line function down to 8 lines, and that makes me feel much happier.I could just extract the if ladder, but I think handing back the function pointer gives me a path to eliminating the ifs altogether.I was baulking at the invocation (this-&gt;*of) malarkey, but std::invoke cleans that up.Right now, then, I think I like where the code is.

Because my Dad was (and I assume still is) a snob without much to be snobby about, one of his favourite things to do when I was a kid was leap from the sofa and point to someone on the telly - politician on the news, actor, cricketer, whomever - and say "I was at university with him".It was, to my recollection, exclusively a him. I assume they did let women into Cambridge in the 60s, but presumably none of them crossed my Dad's sofa-leaping threshold.
I later came to realise that "I was at university with" actually meant "I was at university at approximately the same time as that person, although I had no interaction with them at all and didn't realise they were even there until much later"
In that spirit then "I was at university with Eluned Morgan, the new First Minister of Wales, and Natalie was actually on the same course"
After all, if you go to one of the three great universities, you're bound to cross paths with the great and good at some point.
All this "I was at university with" stuff meant I thought my Dad actually had a degree, but the quite important detail he'd omitted was that he'd been 'sent down' (that's Cambridge talk for kicked out) in his third year. I don't know what for, but I'd put money on excessive drunkenness.
I'm pretty sure the only reason he got in was my Grandad's personal connections. My Grandad was recruited by John Maynard Keynes to set up and run the Cambridge Arts Theatre. Keynes was Master of Kings College at the time, and although he'd been dead for years by the time my dad went to university, I don't believe it was a coincidence he was admitted to Kings College.

But a isn't usable after the catch, right?
how about changing the call, rather than the call site? function a_something() {   try {     return something();   } catch(e) { handleError()}    return whatever_the_fallback_is } const a = a_something()  console.log("let's go a! ", a);
If the call to something() throws, a isn't usable so the fact that a is out of scope in the catch is good. It's preventing you from using an uninitialiaed variable. Unless, that is, there's some recovery and fallback position in the catch.If there is, then either a has to be mutable or you add an extra level of indirection in the form of the wrapper function to get your single assignment back. (Or you go to var, but ain't nobody wants that)
If the consequence of preferring const, which we agree is good, is a few small functions that doesn't feel to me like a huge penalty.
If something() is recoverable, wrap it's try/catch so you get your const a. If it isn't, then you don't need the try catch at callsite, it can be higher up the stack. And you still get your const a back

During a late-90s pub conversation  and I tried to work out how many people in the UK were making their own zines.After exhaustively enumerating everybody we knew, and we were pretty well connected, and adding on people we didn't know but knew people who knew them, and then lobbing in a fudge factor, we came up with a lower bound of about 200.
Our upper-bound was approximately the population of the UK. Your nextdoor neighbour might have been running off issues of her science fiction poetry collection after hours on the office photocopier for years. You would never know and never find out, because you weren't plugged into the science-fiction poetry networks.
Your postie might have had an idea, because they received an unusually large number of hand-addressed A5 envelopes, some with little üëΩ faces drawn on them. Nobody else would have an inkling, not even your neighbour on the otherside who maintained a regular correspondence with the readers of the Squad Leader gamezine his old mate from university puts out every three or four months.
I've done nine issues of my comic, and even though I haven't made one for made 25 years, I still think of it as "nine issues so far".

Pascal isn't really a prerequisite. I first read it in my early 20s, so a good ten years after it was first published, and it was, essentially, my introduction to Unix tools and small pieces loosely joined. Reading now, in my 50s, I can appreciate it as both a piece of history, but also a example of pretty much everything I'm looking for in software development. I've gone back to it over and over, and my enjoyment persists.

It's meant to be our first game of the new hockey season today, but we won't be playing because the opposition have sacked off. Bastards.They can't, apparently, "raise a team". Given that they have 6 teams entered in the leagues, making them not just one of the biggest clubs in Wales but in the UK, I find that a little surprising. I think what's happening is that faced with the reality of actually travelling players, or more likely for this team their parents, have baulked.
Oh god, yes.
Well, either they want to play or they don't, but the reality of minority sport is you've literally got to put the miles in.And when you do, you actually have a great time. I hope they buck their ideas up and get it together.

Little bit more lifting and tightening.I've got a function that's 26 lines bracket to bracket and it's giving me the ick, but I'm a tired boy. I'll deal with it tomorrow.
I'm going through a bit a phrase at the moment - Zuma, Rust Never Sleeps, the new live album Up, Dume (which is an album from the 70s that didn't get released until this year). A ton of different versions of studio and live versions of Ride My Llama, basically, which got me thinking "takes", which is a term I associate almost entirely with you, so just wondered.
I think I'm going round on those albums, rather than my favourite single album Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, because that's such an intense album you need time to recover afterwards.And yes, I'm an album listener, I don't shuffle. And I don't have anything close to the size of the library you do, but I guess few do üôÇ
I can listen to, for example, Radio Paradise, which is has so little DJ chat you might mistake it for shuffle if you didn't know it was a radio station, but it's the human hand there that makes a difference.I know you like a jump from Billie Holiday to Mahler, but me?

I put together something with a classic STL container interface, with a nicely behaving iterator and all that. But that's not what I need.

I like it - I like it a lot (and I'd say that even if I hadn't done some very similar in my own python code not a week or so ago). From memory, you've done similar things in your Lua code too. You're left with less code for the same functionality. What's not to like?
I'd argue this _is_ just plumbing. Adding a whole load of properties that all just forward to an underlying object is tedious to write, and obfuscates the parts of the class which does do something more significant.An alternative would be to inherit from the knowledge class, but I get the feeling that python programmers really frown on inheritance

Amanda Grant's The Joy Of Vegan Cooking is, despite its slightly hokey title, one of the few vegan cookbooks I'd absolutely recommend. It has a cheerful tone, presents straightforward recipes that use fresh ingredients to make good food. It was my everyday cookbook for an extended period, and the battered and stained state of my copy attest to its "higher then normal number of recipes that you will actually cook" quotient.
Rukmini Iyer's Green Roasting Tin's gimmick is straightforward - all the recipes involve sticking everything into one pot and then into the oven. The most complicated involved opening the oven a bit later and stirring. The recipes are simple, imaginative, and delicious. We use it a lot.
Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's been on something of journey over the years. You might recall one of his earlier books had a picture of a him hungrily eyeing a piglet he had tucked under his arm. Well, this book has a picture of him with a big ole cabbage leaf. Some terrific recipes, lots of ideas and suggestions beyond recipes and into cooking more widely, working with what's available (in shops, or your garden, should you have one). Really good, really helpful.

Oh, I'm small fry too üôÇ I only do one talk a year max, I don't do one every year, and I've only ever submitted to ACCU and NorDevCon, so I'm in a bit of a different position. This year I submitted this talk to both, and was surprised by the result. I'd anticipated yes from NorDevCon and no from ACCU, rather than the other way around. I've only been speaking for 20 years, though, so what do I know?
If you want to get into the weeds on this you should (and I know this isn't really your format) get someone on from The National Archive. They're in the business of long long long term document storage, and what they do is pretty incredible
Have occasionally called this rehydration. Does that help?
Can confirm. I've consulted for them a few times and would (and indeed hope to) do so again.
Incredible work!

Yea sure, it's a gentle comedy podcast in which a fake judge hears low-stakes disputes between friends and family, but every now and again I'm brought to tears by John Hodgman's kind, gentle, and thoughtfully humane rulings.  
If you got a dog, you could listen to it while you were out walking it, then the problem wouldn't arise.

Bollocks. Religious schools are a pox on the education system. 
A few years ago a non-religious school near us became de-facto religious by partnering with the local C of E primary and giving its pupils preferential access. 
There's an idea, frequently promulgated by supporters of religious schools, that these schools are somehow just the same as all the others except they say "C of E" or "RC" on the sign by the gate. Where I used to live in Birmingham, the number of Muslim pupils attending church supported schools was used as evidence that such schools are open and inclusive, and indeed popular with Islamic families because they promote similar values.
Maybe they didn't have a great deal of choice. All the primary schools nearest us were Church of England or Roman Catholic.Now, I'm not religious but if my kids had to walk into school every day past a statue of the Virgin Mary, a picture of the Pope, and a sign saying _This week we are praying for &lt;insert curriculum area&gt;_ here I'd be pretty pissed off. I imagine that if I followed another religion entirely, I'd be biting my tongue every single day of my child's school career.
Of course not every Muslim or Hindu or Christian or whatever family is hugely observant, but that stuff must stick in the craw of a lot of kids and a lot of parents. We avoided the local schools by sending our kids further down the road. They avoided us by weighting people without a professed religion to the bottom of their admissions list. I'm not entirely sure I'm heading here, other than to argue the religious schools, while not necessarily actively malign, aren't benign either.
Sat down with the laptop, but accidentally ended up writing about the time I got hit on the head with a crowbar.Anyway, I *really* don't recommend it. At a minimum, it's really very painful, at worst, you know, you might die.
Awk, obviously!
Don't ask me how I know, but there's a biscuit crisis building in the Maths Institute senior common room at the University of Warwick, lads
It's not like I write awk all the time, and if I do it tends to be little things that get chucked away - yoink some things out of a file in this shape, and put them over that in the shape, that kind of thing.
Years ago, I worked on a system, part of which was a kind of Smalltalk but written in C. I wrote quite a large (for awk) script that parsed out the C headers in order to build a class hierarchy for the Smalltalk. It's output was a bit ascii-art diagram, iirc cross-reffed into the headers.Armed with that, I was able to actually cull out about the half the code, because I could show it was never called.
Of course, the real reason I like awk is because I love Brian Kernighan
ATTENTION BIRMINGHAM FIELD AGENTS!We are entering First Ice Cream Van Of The Year season. Please be on FULL ALERT until stood downPlease record time and place of sighting, and if possible name on the van (Raja's Ices, etc), chimes (Greensleeves, etc), and any other pertinent details. You are not obligated to buy an ice cream, but field expenses will be reimbursed.      Feel free to share, and alert your friends and neighbours.
We use an enamelled metal breadbin. Maybe that works?
Most of the time they already know the answer and are just messing with you üôÑ
Underneath the Smalltalk layer was pre Ansi C, proper K&amp;R 1st ed stuff, and above it was a Forth interpreter.At the same place I later spent two weeks isolating a bug in a Scheme interpreter.
Built for 5 different Unixes, on 4 different architectures, plus Windows NT. It was perhaps the most heterogeneous computing environment I've ever worked in.

Especially as I think they need to caveat the caveats. In the two years since we first specced our build, Cops have gone from 3.5 to 5 so even cheaper to run. Ours, installed in December, is so quiet you pretty much have to stick your ear right next to the fan to hear anything.
I'll say it out loud, just so we're clear - I love you, I love your work, and I'm pretty sure I'd love your dog if we ever met. It's not really my place to be, but I'm proud of you anyway.
This turned out to be not quite true, but I think it's true now. (Unless I spot something else I've missed üôÑ

Budget cuts
Six weeks to go, and finally written the first slide of my talk. It's an invitation to leave for any of the other talks that are on at the same time. They all look really good, and if a bit of messing around with Markov Chains no longer seems appealling, I don't want people feeling embarrassed to just up and leave.
Obviously, the ideal is that everyone leaves, then I wouldn't have to do mine, I can also go to one of the other talks, still get my hotel comped. All round win. Bit of a high stakes gamble, though. Should probably prep something.
On the other hand, it's entirely possible people will be so knackered after a day of chewy high-strength C++, that some light JavaScript and a bit of Jane Austen might be something of a relief. 
The invitation to leave is something I put in the very first talk I did, 20 years ago. I was talking about C++ iostreams, specifically about implementing your own stream classes, and I was in genuine fear that a standards implementor might be in the talk and I'd be paralysed. Fortunately he wasn't (and this year is scheduled against me!) so it all went fine.
Ha! I should know this, but a I'm struggling. I used do whirl in a lab were some of the follow up isotopic analysis was done after the initial site identification in 1991
Plagued by doubt, inability to concentrate, stress, worry. Thought about jacking the whole thing in and withdrawing. Walked dogs and decided to email, saying I was struggling, offering to withdraw now if that was best or if they were happy to give me more time to sort myself out. Immediately felt better, and cranked out the whole of the opening section.
Quack!
It's 5 o'clock somewhere!
It's blowing a gale out on the cliff path today, and a beautiful pair of choughs have appeared from below, rising up and over my head, just holding on the wind, then they turned and dived back down out of site.
Yep, that's a vizsla.
They all have the same slightly worried expression
Well, it's been good knowing you, Arthur
Five weeks to go. Situation is clearing, although not heard back from conference. Still trying to press on. Lot of sport going on at the moment though.

No problem. I'll answer the ready questions first, and pick up the rest over the next day or two üôÇLtd Company and VAT registration is basically mandatory. It's what people expect, whether working through agencies or direct, and will get very confused if you're not.
The difference between contracts inside IR35 and outside IR35 is the way they're taxed. Inside IR35 is, basically, taxed at source so company receives net income which is not taxed further. Outside IR35 work as you'd expect - you raise an invoice, it gets paid, company disburses as it likes.(I have never worked inside IR35, but that's the essence. Onus is now on client to make determination, they tend to be conservative, so not a point of negotiation)
Most contracts bill on a time basis. Years ago this was hourly, now daily. So every week, fortnight, month, you raise an invoice for time worked out.If you're working through an agency, you'll invoice them. Agencies generally set the billing schedule, usually monthly, sometimes weekly. They generally pay very promptly.If you're working direct, this is a point of negotiation. I generally bill monthly with payment in 14 days.
Contracts through agencies are often quite vague - "Java, 3 months". Agencies very rarely vary from that model, and often regard longer as better (ymmv)
If you can find work direct, then it all opens up. I've done work on fixed price basis, fixed time basis, staged deliveries, part time, draw down, retainer, all sorts.However, this kind of work is rarely advertised (which I appreciate doesn't help much). What I've had has kind of found me - people have referred me, or said to give them a call if I'm looking, etc, and things have kind of worked out.I hate to say networking pays, but having friends and even a small profile helps
Phone keyboard really butchered some of that (lettuce bags?) . Have edited, hopefully makes more sense now
Are you ever on an appropriate bicycle, Kim?
All agents stand down! The First Ice Cream Van of The Year has been recorded, and the analysis is done.Thanks to  and many other Field Agents for their efforts.
16 slides (of N) pretty much done. Might actually have finished the introductory ramble and started the actual stuff.
I mean, it's not out of reach! We believe in you, Paul!
This is my jam
Do you have Junior Carrot Patrol too?
Honestly I can't remember. They might have gone to Oxfam in Coventry (the absolute best place to donate comics too - guy there has been doing it years, specialises in comics and related nonsense, does great work), they might be in a box in Daniel's attic, or (less likely) they might be in lock-up in Goodwick. But it's true. I do love a Rick Geary comic, and he has made many, many wonderful books, of which Junior Carrot Patrol are some of the most delightful.
Read an issue of Usagi Yojimbo (the greatest long form comic there is) as little settler, and then banged out another 4 slides in an hour. I'm cooking on a mid-priced induction hob!
You felt a rising force?
Yes, this - it doesn't matter how we got to where we are, nor does it matter why it needs to change - "it's the difference between the design we have, and the design we now know we need"
‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you
It's Thursday evening, and I'm still thinking about the fried breakfast I made for brunch on Sunday.
Another hour tonight. Did another slide or so. Ran through what I've got so far. On track to go long (standard). Need to remember to take a Cyclestreets screen shot at the weekend (because I'll actually be out on a road and not a cliff path).
Very good
Very handsome!

Up front, not having yet read the paper, does part of signifying the transient nature (or at least the intended nature) of a span?
I'm a function body.  Sourdough base. Love it. I'm in a "I thought I'd written all the code for the talk, but I was wrong phase", which is, naturally, the best bit of writing a talk.
Solid stuff. Went from a single token in, token out to a configurable window - so predict based on two or three or how many tokens. While I'm not explicitly putting the shoes to LLMs, turning the window up pretty quickly gets you getting the source text back verbatim, thus revealing the training data. Result!
